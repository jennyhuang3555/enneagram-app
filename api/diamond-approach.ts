Intro on how to interpret the points
Idealized qualities

To begin with, each Enneagram point represents a quality of consciousness, or a pattern of energy. By default, we experience all 9 within us.

Our Enneagram “type” often develops as a reaction to qualities that were not supported in our early environment – i.e. we developed strategies (“fixations”) to regain contact with qualities and aspects of ourselves that we've lost touch with. Each of the Ennea-types comes up with strategies to recapture the missing quality of being that we are no longer consciously in touch with.

We tend to idealize certain qualities related to our type, and this idealization is really a way of covering up the absence of those qualities in our lives (“Ego ideals”). For example, if we have lost contact with true strength, the ego will fabricate the appearance of strength to cover up the painful absence of experiencing this quality. 

Our goal is to more fully recognize how we try to fabricate or cover up missing qualities and to regain contact with the true qualities that are there.

Point 8 - “True Strength”

Quick Intro on point 8

“Eights tend to be self-confident, domineering, controlling, and no-nonsense kinds of people. These are the bad boys of the enneagram, eager to get down and get dirty. They prefer to be in charge and running the show, giving orders rather than taking them. Often they are big and blustery— energetically if not physically—making their presence felt and determined to get their way. With a fundamental orientation that life has treated them wrong, they are out for justice and to set things right by exacting vengeance—hence the name of this ennea-type,  Ego-Revenge.” There is the sense that there has been some injustice and they have to set it right. Eights are big on justice.

The Ego ideal for point 8 is, above all, the need to be strong. 
The ideal self is strong, self-sufficient, not brought down by anything, the boss in charge. Who I need to be and how I need to come across is the image and the felt sense of a strong human being.
It tends to push away "soft emotions", our sensitivity and our vulnerability. It pushes away our fear, our sadness, our sense of loss and feelings of hurt – an eight may feel all of those things but they are pushed out of the heart.
This is really a distorted view of what strength is – more on this later…
Exercise 1 
The best way to begin exploring our felt experience of this Point is by examining our relationship with strength.
Here I’d really suggest a dyad practice. You can partner up with someone in the group, a friend, or do some solo journaling / speaking aloud. 
The invitation is to really search in your soul to uncover what do these words and concepts actually mean for you? Don’t just stop at the surface level “head” answers.   
What is your experience of strength? What are all the ways you have been trying to be strong, or tough? 
What qualities do you consider to be weakness? How do you deal with them when they come up? 
Are you afraid of strength? How so?

Part 2 - TRUE STRENGTH

The essence of point 8 - TRUE STRENGTH
What the Point 8 fixation is really trying to produce is the quality of “true strength”.
This is the capacity to initiate things, the courage to take risks, to voice truths even in the face of opposition or discomfort, to venture into uncharted territories.
At its core, this quality is about alignment with one's deepest values and beliefs. When we have it, we can take a stand for what really matters to us, stand up for ourselves and speak our truth rather than conform to external expectations. It’s also the spark that ignites passion and propels us forward in pursuits of our goals.
Somatically - it feels like a vibrant life energy, expanding our sense of what's possible, pushing us beyond self-imposed limitations. 
When we have access to true strength, we can be assertive and firm in our convictions without needing to resort to aggression. In essence, this quality is the cornerstone of personal power. 
When we lose contact with this quality, we experience deeply hidden feelings of helplessness, overwhelm, weakness, loss of capacity, and loss of aliveness, becoming disconnected from our core vitality and courage.
In its absence, our ego attempts to produce a false strength. We may become overly tough, try to control everything, act aggressively – this is our poor ego trying to compensate for the loss by mimicking what the true quality of inner strength actually is.
This loss happens to all of us to some degree: Some of us become half-dead, numb to our inner power and passion. For those with a strong drive (like Enneagram Type 8s), being in this deadened state is unacceptable. They refuse to exist without capacity.
As we grow in our ability to reconnect with the essence of this quality, we develop more capacity to confront our vulnerabilities. We are more able to feel the deficiency and face the helpless feelings and fears within. 

Dyad Practice Instructions (10 minutes each):
Partners take turns asking and answering questions.
When answering, don't overthink. Allow spontaneous responses, even if they seem nonsensical. 
Aim for simple, concise answers rather than monologues.
Let your answers surprise you and avoid censoring yourself.
If you draw a blank, ask your partner to repeat the question.
Remember, you're not responsible for entertaining your partner when answering.
First Question: 
Person A asks: "Tell me a way you experience the absence of the quality of true strength." 
Person B responds: "The way I experience it is like this..."
Second Question: 
Person A asks: "Tell me a way you experience the quality of true strength." 
Person B responds: "I experience it as…(e.g., a feeling of courage…)" 

Potential problematic patterns for 8:
1) Rebellion Against Authority:
Seeing themselves as above authority and resist conventional limitations. This defiance can sometimes work against them, leading to unnecessary conflict. While challenging limits has helped them feel in control, it can prevent them from receiving guidance and support. 
“In what ways don't you accept conventional limitations? In what ways do you see yourself as above authority?” 
2) Overcompensating for Weakness:
To avoid feeling weak or vulnerable, Type 8s adopt an approach of power and dominance. Anger and confrontation become tools to assert control, hiding any sense of insecurity beneath a tough exterior. 
“When do you express power to mask fear or insecurity?” 
3) Denial of Vulnerability:
Tendency to deny emotions they associate with weakness, such as guilt, doubt, or fear. This denial prevents them from processing emotions fully, sometimes leading to explosive outbursts when these feelings inevitably surface. 
“When do you judge yourself as being weak when you have certain softer feelings? What feelings do you push away because they seem weak?”  
4) Impact on Relationships:
The need to project strength can create distance in relationships and leave the 8 feeling isolated, often without understanding why. Their intense energy can overwhelm others, leading to withdrawal. The healthiest relationships develop when people feel safe sharing their deepest vulnerabilities
“Do people often step back from you, and if so, why?” 
“What would shift in your relationships if you showed my softer side more often?”
5) Health and Emotional Consequences:
Pushing through life with relentless force, Type 8s often deny their own limits until a crisis forces them to confront these boundaries. Unchecked intensity can lead to burnout, strained relationships, or even serious health issues.
“Where do you ignore your limits until it’s too late? How would you benefit from moderating energy and allowing yourself to rest?”


Point 7 - Pleasure Vehicle
The Type 7 is the “Enthusiast”. At their best, 7s are inspiring, high energy, expressive, curious, imaginative, full of ideas. They are the “eternal children”.  
7s are driven by a hunger for experience – hence the major vice is gluttony: wanting it all. At their worst, this leads to chronic indecision, FOMO, a habit of starting many new projects but not following through.
Impatience often robs their joy – they want it all and they want it now. 
7s often don’t see that behind the forward movement constantly driving them is fear (not wanting to feel the pain, anxiety, deficiency or boredom if they remained as they are)
The need for freedom is core. The real reason for this is that 7s carry a sense of needing to take care of their own needs to ensure their happiness – there is a deeper distrust that things will unfold naturally without their intervention. Hence the “planning fixation” develops – the mind (or ego self) believes it’s the one who needs to “figure things out” in order to secure the optimal life, and continues to scheme and strategize to make sure that we get what we think we need, while missing the actual treasures that are here right now.
And so we insist on having options. This can trap us in indecision, never fully committing to anything.
And this also means a tendency to live (mentally) in the future, failing to be in the present moment – and so even when we get what we want, it falls short in terms of what the heart truly longs for.
Growth path 
The growth for 7 is to learn that the fulfillment we're seeking is ultimately an inside job. Both fulfillment and inner freedom are properties of presence itself - if we truly want to be whole, we are only going to find it in here. 
We need to ask ourselves: Are we more devoted to pleasure, or to truth and discovering our fundamental nature? 
We need to allow ourselves to feel uncomfortable, unpleasurable and painful experiences – being with these and not being afraid of it or distracting ourselves with fun novel experiences. 

Key patterns to watch for, seen in the point 7:  
#1. Inability to land: Constantly moving from one thing to another, driven by a momentum that masks underlying anxiety.
#2. External fixation: Believing that fulfillment comes from external sources (jobs, objects, relationships) rather than internal
#3. Avoidance of suffering: Putting on a show of being worry-free and using positivity to deflect from dealing with real pain or difficulties
#4. Gluttony for experience: Attempting to fill an inner emptiness through constant external stimulation and new experiences.
#5. Fierce independence: Struggling to trust others or natural processes, leading to an overemphasis on self-reliance and control.
#6. Fear of / rebellion against any kind of constraint: Insisting on having multiple choices to feel free, which can lead to indecision and lack of commitment.
#7. Future fixation: Constantly planning and anticipating the future at the expense of being present in the moment.
#8. Emotional avoidance: Tendency to shut down to suffering and retreat into the mind rather than facing emotions directly.
#9. Impatience: Expecting instant results and struggling with long-term processes, which can hinder personal growth and happiness.
#10. Idealization: Seeing people and experiences as better than they are, which can lead to unrealistic expectations and disappointment.

Core motivations
As 7s, we experience an inability to land, skittering from one thing to another, living off momentum that keeps us motivated. At our core, we sense an inner deficiency that we believe will be fixed by something external - the right job, a yummy object, the perfect relationship, or an exciting holiday. This is our survival strategy, a way of coping with difficult experiences by thinking, "down the road it will be better."
Our ego ideal is happiness, delight, and satisfaction. We strive for deep, abiding fulfillment and freedom, wanting openness, spontaneity, and lightness. However, this forward momentum is rooted in anxiety. Being an Enneagram Seven doesn't give us a get-out-of-jail-free card from human suffering, though we often put on a show of being worry-free.
The vice of 7 is gluttony for experience. We try to fill ourselves through external stimulation, but beneath this lies anxiety, and below that, emptiness – experienced as an inner aridity. This gluttony relates to the Buddhist idea of the hungry ghost - a part of the human soul that's like an empty sack trying to be filled.
This strategy springs from an underlying lack of trust in others. 7s believe we need to take care of our own needs and ensure our own happiness and freedom. For our ego, freedom is having options and more choices. The more driven by anxiety we are, the more we insist on options. This can trap us in indecision, never fully committing to anything.
7s are fixated on planning and anticipating the future – an attempt is based on not trusting what is going to unfold naturally. This often means failing to be in the present moment, and whatever we acquire from the outside keeps coming up short in terms of what the heart truly longs for. 
Growth path 
For 7s, our heart tends to be our weak link. We often shut down to suffering and move into the mind to try to figure out solutions. Impatience wrecks a lot of our happiness - we're impatient with processes and with ourselves, expecting instant results.
The growth for 7 is to learn that the fulfillment we're seeking is an inside job. Both fulfillment and inner freedom are properties of presence itself. When we're present, breathing consciously and actually in the moment, our soul starts to receive the impressions it longs for.  If we truly want to be whole, if we truly want to abide in the truth of what we are, we are only going to find it in here. 
In essence, real satisfaction and fulfillment is not created by the content of experience but by the quality of our presence and attention in any experience we have.
One crucial path to growth for us is allowing the sense of unpleasure within our experience and not being afraid of it. To do this, we must explore why we fear it:  what are we afraid will happen if we let ourselves feel disconnected from an inner sense of pleasure? These fears are often just beliefs, not truths.
When we take the leap of faith and let ourselves feel what seems awful, we discover that we can survive it. In fact, it can open up and reveal what it was obscuring.
We also need to examine our allegiances and devotions. We need to ask ourselves: Are we more devoted to pleasure, or to truth and discovering our fundamental nature? 
As healthy Sevens, our brilliance and knowledge serve people's healing and happiness, not just our own. We're not afraid of sadness or depression. We know our light is real when it can shine in darkness.
Dyad prompt
Prompt #1: “A way I try to make myself happy is….”
Prompt #2: “I have found deep satisfaction in…”


Point 6 - Personal Will 
“The Skeptic”

Core Motivations  
In Point 6, we long for stability, with an ego ideal of steadiness. 6s try to create external circumstances that will provide inner stability - a steady job, money in the bank, children in the right schools. We're always trying to handle life, moving towards steadiness, equating it with safety.

We're persistent, admiring those who stick with something and push through barriers. This persistence manifests in our capacity to do whatever it takes to produce stability, whether in choosing partners or managing finances.

We want to know the structures, rules, and how things work. We create systems and methods, hoping they'll one day give us confidence and safety.

Passion: Fear
Our core passion is fear. 
The tendency is to overthink, trying to figure everything out to create stability. 
Our self-defeating pattern lies in constantly thinking about what could go wrong. This anxiety keeps us at a distance from the inner stability we're seeking. Paradoxically, in real danger or crisis, this overthinking falls away, and another kind of knowing kicks in.

Relationship with Authority
We're both the biggest skeptics and believers when it comes to authority. We look to extrinsic sources to make sense of the world and give us stability. When we find an authority we trust, we become very defensive and protective of that perspective.
The problem with this strategy is that our inner authority gets projected outward. We don't want to see the humanity of the authority figures we invest our trust in.

Growth path
We all live within systems of methods, procedures, and beliefs that create stability for us. But real inner work will start to take us out of those systems, challenging our structures and inner authorities.

Our big lesson is learning to trust ourselves and our nature, finding what we're looking for internally rather than externally. When we find our true nature, it makes us far more skillful at dealing with external challenges, and we're no longer driven by fear. We learn that the only place we'll find permanence is inside ourselves, not in external circumstances.

The true quality type 6’s are going for is Personal will  – the inner strength that keeps us steadfast in any endeavor, helping us push through challenges and stay true to our commitments. 

It’s the grounded capacity to keep going, no matter how difficult or unpleasant the path becomes. This quality anchors us, allowing us to connect with a sense of inner authority instead of seeking validation or guidance externally.

The highest way in which it manifests is as a sense of effortlessness.

Dyad Exercise
Going back and forth 10 mins per question 
Q1: Tell me a way you are disconnected from your will. (how is life like?)
Q2: Tell me something that disconnected you from your will. (sense into, what are some of the experiences that made you not trust your own knowing?)
Q3: Tell me a way you experience the presence of will.




Point 5
Holding On and Retaining Energy
Fives are known for their tendency to hold on, not only to their energy but also to their internal world. They conserve energy, avoiding too much exertion, and often keep their emotional life private, rarely expressing it openly. 
This strategy often leads to a strong sense of isolation, making it difficult for them to form deep connections with others. As they pull back from the outer world, they also disconnect from themselves, resulting in a pattern of hiding and holding on, which distances them from their true nature.
Living Through the Mind
For Fives, life is lived through the mind rather than through direct engagement. They prioritize knowledge and understanding, believing that accumulating more information will make them feel safe enough to face life’s experiences. This intellectual focus leads to a disconnection from the body and emotions, as they attempt to make sense of the world purely from a mental standpoint. 
However, this accumulation of knowledge, without experiential engagement, fails to change them on a deeper level, keeping them stuck in a preparation mode—always getting ready to live but never fully stepping into life.
you think that eventually, if you know enough stuff, if you have enough skills, if you have memorized so many things, then you will finally know. You will finally know what is going on and be able to join the world
The Cost of Withdrawal and Isolation
The habitual withdrawal and detachment that define Fives’ lives serve as both a defense mechanism and a source of deep suffering. 
By pulling away from both negative and positive experiences, they end up living in a state of aloneness and emptiness. Although this detachment is meant to protect them, it results in a profound existential pain, as it cuts them off from love and true contact with others. 
Growth path
True transformation for Fives lies in contact—presence with themselves and others. The path forward involves breaking through the shell of detachment and risking being affected by life’s full intensity. 

Exercise Questions 
Question #1: Tell me a way you maintain distance.
can be internal, external, whatever comes to mind, just let it be as spontaneous as possible.
Question #2: Tell me a way you substitute knowledge for direct experience.

Finding and integrating the key for one’s particular type opens the door. But passing through it to greater spiritual development and openness requires accessing all nine keys since ego is composed of all the fixations and their delusions, even though one of them predominates

Day 1
Originally, about looking at barriers to our contemplation, preventing us from landing in deeper experince of being human
Fundamentally it's about learning how to live from greater presence
What we do in meditation is practising being here in a way that isn't just our personality patterns - occupy more totality of our humanity
A salutation to the ground of being

Gurjeff - the centres, The Fourth Way --> NOT a renunciate path, requires us to be in life, but requires immense dedication
body: working against impulses of the body
heart: the way of devotion, transforming ordinary emotions into something deeper
mind: "way of the quiet mind"
When we're caught in personality, we're not in any centre. in the Fourth way, you need to find and occupy the centres, then they organically begin to line up

Law of 7 - law of development and change
Things dont devleop linearly. They jump. "shock points"

Enneagram is NOT about understanding our ego so that we can have a new and improved upgraded model of personality structure
It is to support the unfolding of you and the more conscious becoming, knowing, and living the depth of what you truly are
In that healing, the passion is transmuted into what we call the virtue.
Point = energy of a point, talking about it more as a quality of consciousness, of being
There are nine deluded views, erroneous views, distorted views of reality. Taken together, they contribute to egoic reality
the qualities characterized by the heart point have to do with - qualities that were not supported in our family of origin, our ennea-type is a kind of reaction formation to what was not tolerated, what was not allowed.
Each of the ennea-types comes up with the strategy to recapture the missing quality of being that we are no longer consciously in touch with.
The facsimile also shows up as what we idealize e.g., 2s - to idealize merging, closeness, being someone that other people want to confide in, that they want to be close to, that they love.
the facsimile is also a way of covering over the absence of intouchness with that quality -- a sense of lack is left in the wake of losing contact with the quality of being-->  inquire into how we attempt to cover up, how we attempt to fabricate that quality
exercise: Ego ideals
explore what are qualities that you personally idealize?
What are the qualities of being a human being that you try to live up to?
You can also begin to identify what your ego ideal is by looking at what are the people in life who you idealize, who you think really fit the bill of what is wonderful. What are the qualities that those people have that resonate for you?

courage - not fearing the struggle, daring to go where others dont
Big hearts -- fearless love. Really acting from here
being in service of something greater than themselves, selflessness - people so moved by purpose they can do anything, no matter how hard -- strength of conviction?
discipline -- ability to move past personal resistance/attachment and do what's right, dedication, devotion -- keeping at something without need for instant reward or recognition 
compassionate and wise -- like guides, medicine women, who *know* and can help lead the way 

Sensitivity
we are born sensitive to one particular Holy Idea which in effect means that we are born sensitive to one particular point, one ennea-type
the qualities at the heart point (release / growth), the point preceding ours if you are following the arrows of flow, are  qualities that we exhibited early as a child
If those qualities were not tolerated and not supported in our family of origin, from that view it looks like we become our ennea-type as a kind of reaction to what was not held and supported --> i.e. a deeper layer of your personality as 7 is 5 (these qualities typically gets suppressed because weren't allowed)
part of the path to claiming the whole of ourselves to actually integrate those qualities of the heart point.
there is no healthy version of the type without an integration of the healthy heart point. You will not find it. There is no healthy eight that have not found some two.
when people are very traumatized, they can hang out more in their stress point (defensive point) / stretch point (7 --> 1) but that is a trauma response.
Wings
Claudio taught us about the wings is that our type is really the intersection of both wings and
 the interplay of them


Table
Point 8 - Strength
Red
"I can"


Point 6 - Personal will
White
"I will"
Belly and the abdomen, the solar plexus area

Point 8 - Strength
Ways of getting in touch with it:
recognizing how we compensate for intouchness with it.
y feeling the absence of it in our own consciousness

Presence practice
Enneagram is a guide to coming into presence.
Sit relaxed but alert, awake. Not slumpy. Look for it! Dont trust that the automatic way we're sitting is already there.
Look for sensation -- as we're more present, we notice initially more sensation.
In DA, we find the belly centre ("kath")
Bring attention to breath and sensation. You'll feel a shift as you do that.
starting with 8
this journey first of get here, get home, get to where the action is, and then other things can flower from that.
the energy of eight itself is kind of a wonderful initiating energy. It kicks things off.
Playing hard / living hard - a lot of eights have a higher than normal percentage that die in their forties and fifties and early sixties because they just wear out their nervous system. --> stress and cardio vascular problems


Ego ideal (each type models itself on that quality that the person of that type has lost the immediacy of contact with)
above all, need to be strong
ideal self is strong, self-sufficient, not brought down by anything, the boss in charge. Nobody can mess with me
pushes away "soft emotions", pushing away our sensitivity, pushing away our vulnerability, pushing away our fear, our sadness, our sense of loss, feelings of hurt in particular, an eight may feel all of those things but they are pushed out of the heart

really being able to confront a situation that is challenging for you, that is hard for you, can make you feel very, very vulnerable.
That kind of vulnerability can actually be a very strong presence and it ties into the quality of True Nature that this ennea-type emulates, imitates

that toughness is I am capable. I can deal with things. It is a big deal when eights start to see and recognize the limitations of what they can control to the degree that we are in touch with what is behind this ego ideal

exercise
what is the place of strength in your life. What do you consider strength to be?
likewise, what does weakness mean to you?
really search in your soul to find and uncover what do those words, those concepts, what do they actually mean for you?
What is your experience of strength? What is your historic and current relationship with strength? Do you idealize it? What qualities do you consider to be weakness? How do you deal with them when they come up? Are you afraid of strength?

Strength -- ability to stare fear in the face. Not stop but persevere. Willingness to feel hurt, confusion,
willingness to self-sacrifice
unyielding -- not bowing down to obstacles
truly knowing oneself and acting in alignment with this -- not compromising for convenience
Where are you strong in your life?
Staying focused on the spiritual path, and being committed to inner work 
Saying things to people sometimes that are hard -- trying to act in accordance with my higher self
How would you step into greater strength?
Putting love and others more above my personal gratification...
Not choosing the "easy way" but feeling into what is true and right
Weakness - acting in fear and denial, not wanting to admit the 'truth' you already know
playing small, compromising and giving way, not standing up for what is 'right' 
Where are you experiencing this 'weakness'?
Not being disciplined - caving in to craving and avoidance at times
Not playing bigger and choosing the comfortable route - not taking the leaps to contribute in a bigger way, putting myself and my own gratification first...
Ego ideal is a particular quality of true nature, of presence
One of the things that characterizes the different qualities of True Nature is we do not have
to name them to know what they are. We just have to be in touch with them. That is what I mean by selfknowing.
"The red"
For 8s, when quite young, quality of presence that is especially meaningful, whose memory in the wake of its loss leads to an attempt to reconnect with that very meaningful, very fulfilling quality of presence (the red - Sufi)
see it in amazing acts of courage
people who speak their mind and say the truth, even when it is not welcomed... When somebody stands up and says what they believe to be true is an act of courage, it takes tremendous strength to do that
courage when we have a difficult conversation
the capacity to initiate things, courage to task risks --> put our asses on the line!
a capacity to be true to ourselves -- you just have to say the truth! -- get clear about what for me really matters, not what everyone else thinks, not what everyone else is doing,
helps us to know that we can do things even when we are not sure that we can
gives us the capacity to stand up for ourselves, to rise to the occasion
gives us the ability to strike out on our own, to separate from the herd, to find our way
the energy behind passion! (whatever that is.... when we feel into the passion driving those endeavours....)
the life force, with a sense of vitality, with the sense of expansion beyond our boundaries
assertive. Aggression is a distortion of the assertiveness of the red

It's always here, but often we don't notice it.
the more we let ourselves feel when we are angry, we do not push it away, we do not try to get rid of it, we also do not act out on it. We do not express it, but we let ourselves contain it and feel the energetic quality of it. If you conjure up right now in your mind something recently that has made you really pissed off, really angry, and you drop the storyline and you feel the anger itself, that energy that vibrant, alive, expansive energy is the red showing up in your consciousness.
this is the energy the 8s aspire to!
the feeling of "I can"
In the eight version of the red (mimicry)
are always having to be strong
Vs if we have access to this quality, and we can utilize it as the situation needs. But we do not always have to have our foot on the gas.
8,9,1 --> are all about Being and Capacity

Essence responds. Ego reacts!
8 gives us the capacity to respond, and 1 gives us the intelligence of the most harmonious response

Diamond approach --> discover the holes, and go into them, rather than avoid it
Tune into red: what is it like to feel alive, vital, real? the potential to take a stand and feel your truth? Lava quality.

The way we get back in touch with the red in a way that it gets integrated is to be able to presence the hole...
Without the red, we are kind of stuck. We will not have the courage to really face our devils, to face our places of bereft-ness, of incompleteness, of helplessness. good news is the red is actually there.
Loss of the Red
= underlying deeply hidden feelings of helplessness, overwhelm, weakness, loss of capacity, loss of
aliveness.
Indicator that sense of the red not being there is that the ego starts to try to produce a false strength by being tough, by taking over things, by aggression, by a pattern of asserting. --> the poor little ego trying to compensate for this enormous loss by doing its version of what the red actually is

We want the real thing. It is part of the way strength manifests in our heart and produces some of that courage. We are willing to pay the price for the real thing.

this loss of red happens to all of us.. (some of us become half-dead, numb...)
but for 8s, being dead is NOT OK, will not accept being without capacity.
As we grow in our capacity to be with the red essence which gives us
more capacity to go into the hole, to feel the deficiency, to feel the lack of capacity, to feel the helpless
feelings, the scaredness that is there.

Have to see through all my fabrications of strength,
What are all the ways I have been trying to be strong?
What are all the ways I have been trying to be tough?
The red, when it is really manifesting full on, tends to be in service - in some union with love supporting self for others. It is not just for me to have my own little empire. It always comes in relation to loving support for the world, for other people

Anger -- art is learning to recognize the anger, to breathe with it, to presence it, to learn to not go to the story of it and the reactivity of it, but to feel it as an energy --> the very heat of anger is the aliveness
Anger is a defense , way of sending off the sense of incapacity, vulnerability, weakness, and for eights it is the prime way
--> revenge for this person, basically, making me feel weak, making me feel incompetent, making me feel like I do not have what it takes, "I dont want to be a victim"
see if you can sense the anger instead of thinking about it--- See what it feels like in your body. Does it have a location? Does it have a temperature? It will really help
 you disconnect from the usual circuit of how it tends to engender stories and images and history
Absence of red in our bodies - make us feel physically weak, can make us feel infirm, or not having the can do, the capacity -- in all 3 centres
absence in the heart is I do not have the capacity to handle this. I am emotionally too fragile. --> vs infusing the heart center makes us lionhearted.
or lacking the mental capacity to master this -- vs sense of I can learn this
Red is the energy of expansion. It is also the energy of separation ("no!")
Exercise
(Dyad practice: 10 mins each. Ask your partner the question and let them answer. When answering, the way to get the most out of this is not to think about the answer. Let whatever comes come, even if it does not make any sense to you. Let the answer surprise you, and don’t censor. If you blank, just ask your partner to ask you again. Remember when you are answering, you have zero responsibility to entertain the other person.)
Frist question
Person A asks ‘Tell me a way you experience the absence of red.’
Person B replies ‘The way I experience it is like this…’
x 10 mins
Swap person B
Second question
‘Tell me a way you experience the red.’ --> Alternating 20 mins
Person B says ‘I experience it as a feeling of courage.’
Person A says ‘Thank you.’
Really get into the red and let it come out
Not a monologue - just give a simple answer
The way you are going to get the most out of this kind of exercise is not to think
 about the answer. Let whatever comes come, even if it does not make any sense to you
stuff that is in your unconscious that you might not be at all aware of has the opportunity to
 come out. You know it when you are surprised by the answer you give
Let it come out, don't censor

Tell me how you experience the red?
there is almost moving through the world without effort. No doubt. Is just the right thing to do.
The energy of starting things, creating.
Feels like a fierce love. Fullness in my head and upper body.
It Does not wait.

Point 6 - Personal will
Longing for stability - ego ideal = steadiness
We are trying to create some sort of external circumstances that will create this inner stability. That
is what we hope. Steady job, money in the bank. Get the kids to the right school. We are trying to line up all our ducks and get our life in some sort of order from which we fantasize that one day we will have it set up well enough that we will not be stressing anymore
We equate that stability with a kind of safety. Everything is going to be okay now. I am okay, my property is okay, my loved ones are okay.
We are always trying to think about things and handle things and address things so that we are moving towards that steadiness
BUT we are kind of handling life instead of living it.
Persistence
Sixes are persistent, and they admire people who have persistent. This idea that you might have talent, but it is the people who really stick with something, and do not give up and push through the barriers are the ones that get somewhere
that capacity to do whatever it takes to get through the kind of jitters, fears, reactions, difficulties and to keep doing whatever I can to produce that stability e.g., picking partners, bank account,
Correct orientation - fraught with fear (vigilance, looking for danger)
Yes, I got ground, and I know which way I am going. I want to know what the structures and rules are. I want to know how things work here. I know this is the right way to do a spiritual journey
The part of us that likes to create structures, likes to create systems, likes to have algorithms and methods... --> end with this aim of creating stabilization --> hope it will one day give us confidence, safety

Persistence also = want to know that they have contributed to something that will go on. They want their life to be part of something that has endurance... People in an ideology, or work for govt. My life starts to make sense because I am contributing to systems that I believe in.

Overthinking things -- I am trying to figure everything out to create this stability
there is a reflex in point six of doubting what we know. "I know it is this but what if it is not?"
Skepticism -- we are kicking the tires and making sure it is the real thing
if I am going to invest, and I know from this position I find something worth worthwhile, I will really invest myself, heart and soul in it, whether it is a relationship or a career or an ideology, but I want to make sure it is good and not fraudulent, and not fooling me

PASSION = FEAR
2 types --> both have this adrenalized state
There are phobic sixes who are very much identified with their fear - physical sense of alarm, anxiety, body tightening
counterphobic sixes. They attempt to overcome their fear, to compensate for it. It is the kind of thing that people do like jumping out of an airplane in a parachute. Important for them to really challenge the fear and prove to themselves that they can overcome it. They do not feel the fear. They are not consciously in touch with it. The defense mechanism is so strong that they do not really get in touch with the felt sense of the anxiety and the fear underneath it, but it is there.

Self-defeating
basic nervous system,  our emotions, we are constantly thinking of what could go wrong. the constant overthinking is keeping me kind of ongoingly freaked out. That anxiety that that thinking pattern creates  keeps me at some distance from the inner stability that I am actually looking for. 
The more emotionally freaked out inside, the less we want to be inside of ourselves. The less we want to be present.

The only way you can really get certainty about something is by feeling it in your belly or your heart --> If you are up and away from the parts of you that can make that kind of decisive knowing, then you are trying to figure it out with your head.
--> You are trying to figure it out, but you are not letting yourself drop in enough to really feel it out !
BUt in a danger or crisis, this overthinking and anxiety-based thinking, temporarily falls away, and another kind of knowing, based in this inner stability kicks in.
Authority --> biggest skeptics, and believers!
is like looking to something extrinsic to me to make sense of the world and to give me some kind of stability and orientation.
they are trying to discriminate which of these authorities actually are telling me the truth.
when I find someone who does, I feel very defensive, very protective, like a guardian of that perspective.... creating a field of trust, I am looking for what can be depended on in life.
Problem with this strategy = our inner authority gets projected out (the guru!) --> They do not want to see actually the humanity of any authority figure that they invest their trust in and their devotion.

Attachment to algorithms, methods. This is how you do it!
This is where the loyalty comes in. When I have gone through that trouble to figure out what works in a world where mostly things do not work, please do not mess with my little system
E.g., conservative reaction in a company - I found my place, my security

We all live within a system of methods, procedures, habits, beliefs --  create some semblance of stability and familiarity for us. But if we are really doing the inner work, it will start to take us out of those systems, Things are not, maybe, as reliable!
"we trust everything in life except that which can be trusted, meaning presence."
We will expose how we are creating these structures and inner authorities and beliefs, algorithms, because anytime we are really growing in our being, we are going to be in some sense challenging some of that.
If we are going to do inner work, fear is going to come up ! means that there is some sort of progress. We are actually hitting some limitation, some belief, some structure.
when we feel really lost and remote from that place of certainty, stability, knowing, one way we find orientation is by knowing what we are against -- I know what I dont want!
Impermanence: the six part of ourselves is at odds with - the fear and anxiety resulting from the fact that things change, we are fighting the truth of how things actually are. Hard job - working to fight what the truth is, trying to find solidity in external things that we can depend on - instead of finding  the solidity that is available inside --the ONLY place we'll find that which is permanent.
The external will not compensate for this need -- when we find our true nature, it will make us far more skillful at dealing with external stuff, and we are not driven by fear

How do we do next steps? Well, we are trying to plan it, anticipate it in this kind of fear-based ways.
certain parallel with seven here, the next-door neighbor - but more focused on avoiding mistakes
BUT when we find this place of stability inside, there is a very natural, organic, almost effortless way that we do that. It is very different than our kind of stress-based figuring it all out.

BIG LESSON =learning how to trust ourselves, trust our nature and to find what we are looking for in here and not out there

we start to experience ourself as in the correct place. I am right where I need to be... with the recognition that I am part of something bigger than me.

Exercise
What's your relationship to fear, to anxiety?
What's your relationship toward authority figures
What are things you hang your hat on, that you maybe identify with and hold on to?
Where do you rely on external rules, or codes, or people, or situations or philosophies (a rock you can depend on), to give you a sense of certainty and solidity?
What are your safety and security needs?
How does all of that show up in your life? How does your decision making in life reflect this?

our true nature, our beingness, the dimension of the divine has many different ways in which it arises in our human consciousness. The various spiritual traditions tend to emphasize particular one or several of those ways in which True Nature arises:
Buddhism we see pure awareness as a quality that is emphasized
Sometimes emptiness and other forms of Buddhism, Sunyata, the void
devotional, the bhakti traditions, we see the whole dimension of the loving fabric of reality
Diamond Approach, we attempt to encompass as many of them as possible - open to the possibility that there are many, many different ways True Nature presents itself.

Red = "I can" - rocket fuel that gets the rocket launched into space, energy of beginning
White lataif = "I will" - quality to keep us going, carrying on, continuing, staying steadfast in whatever endeavor we set out on. white has all of the qualities and characteristics that sixes tend to idealize
Understanding that there will be difficulties, and we are going to go through them, and we are going to be okay going through them.
e.g., meditation is a practice that totally requires us being able to stick with it.
I will hang in, no matter how unpleasant it is
the capacity to follow through on our promises, on our projects.
Allows us to connect with the solidity of our nature
sense of groundedness, inner authority -- vs seeking externally or projecting onto others

White takes us out of fantasy - gives us a very solid, grounded capacity to see the world around us, to see the situation we are in, to see ourselves clearly and objectively. That is another way of understanding surrender. Surrender to what is.

typically arises in the belly and the abdomen, the solar plexus area. Very often when it is missing there is a sense of tension or anxiety in those parts of our body.
The inner anxiety is about not having that sense of solidity, not having a sense of security or safety --> but it leads me to explore myself, because in a pre-conscious way or an unconscious way, I know that there is a quality of my nature that is able to handle everything and that is safe and secure
When it comes through --> has the effect of rendering the mind more coherent and to align the centers --> "we are going in this direction"
The highest way in which the White Latifa manifests is as a sense of effortlessness.
Initially, some effort required to say, okay, I got to tear myself away from all that stuff and be here.
White knows  what matters to me, what is significant for me, what am I trying to realize or fulfill within myself and within my life.
Also intelligence to see what is needed rather than what we prefer.
Also ability to sit in our own skin  / own authority, not merge with people and just go along with whatever they do.
Divine will
When we are coming from the ego consciousness, and sitting on top of that angst and uncertainty, and our mind is desperately trying to figure out what to do,
With sense of coherence, it shifts us into a sense of participating in the flow of reality --> we open to a bigger will.
Coherent attention = attentive meaning noticing the details. There is a kind of beautiful devotion. When we do something mindfully, there is heart in that, doing things with care, loving attentiveness.

Vs Iron Will (mimicry)
Rigid, inflexible identification with a position or opinion

How to get in touch with White? ->
working with the emotion of fear and anxiety as well as indecisiveness,... If you really sense into your fear and you let go of what you are afraid of and you just feel the energy itself, energetically you will feel a sense of awakeness, alertness intouchness with the present moment
Fear is a distortion of our capacity to be acutely aware of the present moment
notice the absence of will inside of ourselves, to explore our lack of solidity, our lack of a sense of inner security and confidence in ourselves --> become a portal..
e.g., physically as though there is something missing in the bottom half of our body usually, or there is just a big gaping hole in our solar plexus.
... we have to have the trust to relax our grip on our false will and on the various structures and beliefs, and go into the unknown

When we get in touch with our lack of will, a good line of inquiry is, how did it get to be that way? What happened for me historically, especially when I was little, that undermined my sense of inner authority, my sense of inner solidity, my trust in myself, my capacity to make decisions for myself, my capacity to follow through on things?
often someone imposing their will
breaking our will
or breaking our trust --we learn to not trust our own inner wisdom (because our protectors are telling us things that dont jive with our sense of reality, we have to discount our own will)

Exercise
Going back and forth 10 mins per question
Q1: Tell me a way you are disconnected from your will. (how is life like?)
Q2: Tell me something that disconnected you from your will.
(sense into, what are some of the experiences that made you not trust your own knowing, your own intelligence this way?
Q3: Tell me a way you experience the presence of will.
take this very innocently. Probably your ego mind is going: I do not know. That is why we are doing the exercise.

Other q
where do we have iron Will? (Where we are so incredibly stubborn regardless of how it annoys our friends and loved ones)

Point 2 - merging love
Whats paradoxical is that for all their emotiveness, for all of the high drama sometimes the twos experience, they are not necessarily really feeling what it is that they are expressing.
Let yourself really feel what you are feeling. For twos the expression of it, the putting it out to others, is the key focus rather than the actual living in, feeling in

Ego ideal
The kind of love that forms the ego ideal for twos is a sense of deep intimate, merging connection, going all the way to a sense of oneness
manipulation -- way that a two will attempt to become one with another is by being indispensable to them, by supporting them, by flattering them
What they want is closeness - able to bare their hearts to another and have the other bare their hearts to them
Passion - PRIDE
self-inflation
And also what the self-inflation is compensating for inner lack: feeling worse than everybody else, deep sense of not being as good as the star that they have in their sights, that they want to have the connection with
whole sense of what they have and how valuable they are and all of that comes from the outside, comes from others
twos’ self-esteem really rises and falls depending on how that other sees them -- any sense of rejection --> self-esteem plummets. Avoid Rejection at all cost!

Neediness
Paradox: twos are not that interested in the other, they are interested in is getting their sense of self supported, loved, admired by that person
During Symbiosis (dependent phase merged with mother) - my whole sense of self revolves around a connection with the other
Hence being on their own, being separate, sometimes simply being alone can be really, really hard to tolerate because the sense of self is so fused with having a merged relationship with another
distinct sense of neediness for loving connection can appear as emptiness in lower part of chest
experiencing neediness is very difficult: because acknowledging I'm needing of love is like saying I'm unworthy of love -- since if I was worthy, I'd already have received it... to express neediness challenges the idealised image I have of being lovable
while twos come across as very needy and very dependent, they would never tell you that they are needy. Acknowledging neediness goes against pride.
they also crave freedom, independence and autonomy, because they know how dependent they are on the other and it limits their sense of freedom -- so there's an internal pull to not need anybody
Pride =  the unwillingness and inability to acknowledge one's own suffering, need and
limitation, which is the spiritual disease (Thich Nhat Hanh)
"As soon as you think you transcended the human condition, you can be pretty sure that you have not"
twos have an authentic generosity - natural for them to attend to needs. HOWEVER I have my own subconscious needs hitchhiking on what I am doing for others, and I do not see that part - because having needs becomes confirmation of my worthlessness, unlovability
Pride is in our self-image
The bigger the gap between reality and our self-image, the more painful the reality is to us 
To the extent we feel unloved and unworthy, we tend to inflate ourselves in our own minds, taking the sting out of the painful feelings
Pride is an attempt to offset awareness of the ultimate emptiness of our personality structure
So I'm always checking "are we ok?" -- always looking for reassurance that we are in connection -- because there is this underlying hidden layer of isolation, detachment.
"I am being nicer than anybody, I am doing all this and yet for all of this I still am left with this feeling (of not being lovable)"

Self-abandonment
When my attention is over there with you, if we were in connection, how would I know? Because I am not with me. I am just constantly out there with everybody else.
Paradox: Their heart is completely wide open, and the fact that they are not really inhabiting their own heart can seem so paradoxical
twos tend to end up in relationships where they are not fully loved, where there is some degree of pull back, hold back, where they fall in love with some unreachable person -- because they are having such a hard time letting themselves really take in the fact that they are loved
Because If we do not love ourselves, we cannot take love in -- there's no place for it to land inside.
Co-dependent pattern
providing to the other some kind of need fulfilling function, that makes us needed. But it's a transaction - dependency on the other having a problem or having some lack that we can fill.
What the heart is seeking = relatedness (with humans, animals, -- where your heart feels in communion with the living moment. It is a real human need for liberation)
the more we are insecure, rather than going toward the relatedness, which is what our heart is seeking, we tend to reinforce the structures of relationship in our life (will not provide what the deep heart is seeking).

2v vs 6s - 2s kiss ass, 6s lick boots
2s vs 9s - both service oriented and put others first
9s when stressed, check out (9s quality of love is more universal, general love, vs close intimate contact)
2s move towards the other - to reconnect - to make sure the connection is there, ppl might say "relax, give me some space"

2s have high energy!
If fighting on behalf of someone else, they are almost like an eight.
will walk through fire to make certain things happen (generally on behalf of others) "I hope you'll notice..."
Exercise
15 min diving in - dive in as deep and intimate as you're willing to go. Partners really give them your presence and attention - by being present yourself, focus on staying in touch with your body as you're listening
Then 5 mins when witnesses can ask clarifying questions, with no judgment.
Explore how this ego ideal shows up in your life. Have courage to look at this honestly.
Explore the place of intimate relationship in your life. What is your relationship to intimacy? (intimacy of the heart) What is the place of deep sharing? (Sharing yourself, your experience, your heart - to make contact)
How important has intimate relationship been to you, how much a part of your life’s journey has it been?
What is the place of codependency (giving to get) in your life? Are there situations or individuals that you have a codependent relationship with?
What are the ways in you in which you manipulate to get love and appreciation?
Intimate relationship has been big part; feeling of being really seen, and seeing somebody else - usually romantic.  that merging gold feeling. Time stopping. Feeling significant as a result.
Luke - wanting to be approved of, validated, appreciated.
Dennis - kind of co-dependency as felt pride, the sense of being so important to somebody else.
Now, slighter but desire to be helpful to Bruno (but comes more from love than wanting something back - more tenderness is caring for him)
Manipulation? presenting a selective image to past partners, (E and K) definitely... Also being very careful not to show neediness - the pain of unanswered text message - shows my neediness! cannot not be seen to be more needy of their love at all cost.
Familiar with the feeling of loneliness in relationships where I did not feel the merging, full seeing

Going through the deficient emptiness
It is to go into these holes in our soul, these places where we feel our most sacred parts are missing and to retrieve them by staying present with that form of deficiency
2s -- need to develop that capacity to stay with yourself
the enneagram without presence does not do much is because the whole stuckness of our fixations in our type patterns are the result of our misguided efforts to get back to these essential qualities.
Merging Gold
Union, primarily felt in the heart centre...
"falling in love" is an effort to get back to this sweet tender place where we were at one with someone else... it is not just that we feel connected, we are in some state of fundamental union and it is through our heart that we know that.
that feeling is one of warmth, of gentleness, and of a kind of sweetness in our heart
it brings a quality of relaxation around our edges. We are more willing to let go of our hardened boundaries, our armor, our defenses. that moment where you do not need to keep all the walls up.
Restores our flow and connection with life...
It also lets us let go of our preoccupied thinking, relaxes our thinking.
it pervades the whole presence with this feeling of tenderness.
Sometimes we do not realize how tense we are around our heart and chest
Correct coming together helps the baby regulate nervous system - soothing, fluid, lovely, why being in an intimate connection with someone feels good-- not merely physical pleasure
there is a very explicitly liquid sense to it
feeling with it that you do not have to be so much in control.
When we are intimately connected with someone, we are closer to the realization and the experience of this quality
Our heart knows on some deep level that this is a real thing and it is available.
Even mums- We are completely intoxicated with the one we are in love with
It is easier to notice when we are with someone in some sort of dyad but it does not require a dyad. You can have that feeling with just about anything- you can feel this merging quality with the stars in the night sky.

It is the same condition they are after in the bhakti paths, the devotional spiritual paths - They are after enrapturement with the divine
You are basically giving your heart to the Beloved in an effort to become one with the Beloved .
Rumi has wonderful poems about separation from the Beloved and all of the grief that that brings and of all the intoxication that comes from union.
Intelligence of response - primary kind of intelligence operating in motherhood and in fatherhood, to respond
vs when structuring, we think of it as a transaction
During suffering, merging gold quality coming as a kind of response, soothing and nourishing us
like the ice of our soul melts into a flowing liquid again - helps us lose the sense of being "a thing", merging gold helps us transition and relax into our non-thingness- the perceived boundaries get dissolved...
Can be a moment e.g., NYC subway catching eyes with a stranger - in that moment that merging
 gold helped us remember the deeper truth that is here.

IN therapy/coaching, presence of this quality lets the client trust the process to relax a little bit. If we do not feel there is any love in the space, we are not going to really let go of our boundaries or our defenses
also when we fall in love with our spriitual teachers - transference - It is like True Nature is coming through them in your experience

Growth
instead of fantasizing about what other people need, you are going to be perceiving them more directly, more accurately.
noticing what they really need instead of what you think you want to give them.
Allowing yourself to be cared for and nourished -  no need to martyr yourself be the one that gives everything
as we discover more of the real quality of merging gold, --> we discover That hole in our chest around feeling unlovable, not cared for, alone, isolated -- is not what we thought, merging gold is what is going to help us go through that and resolve some of those old wounds
Real reunion that is trying to happen is a reunion within my own heart.

Quality can be an experience, or become a station, when that quality becomes readily accessible in our soul and living consciousness... becomes part of what we take ourselves to be.
Typically, at the beginning we look for the merging - this experience of yummy sweet all-consuming nectar of love -- and we look for it outside of ourselves, in our relationships
we might look for it in substitutes like foods that feel like might give us a sense of yumminess, deliciousness, goodness, nourishment
pets! > many people experience unconditional love and oneness
transition for us in having merging gold become not just something that happens to us if we are
 lucky, ==> to become a station within us begins with letting ourselves really allow the sense of isolation, aloneness, really let ourselves feel that particular absence (primarily in the heart, something missing in the centre of my soul)
the longing is the heart remembering what it really wants, knows and love.
surrender to our sense of aloneness, not trying to fix it, also not trying to get merging gold to come and solve it,
Doing so, We are turning toward our inner experience
if we can allow ourselves to open to the abyss, and it can feel enormous (all the way back to mom!) - begin to feel the beautiful shimmery, delicious golden presence of merging gold percolating up in here, not out there - discovering the merging happens with me and my nature,
then the two’s fear of being left alone, being isolated, nobody loves me, melts away
The more experiences we have of that going through that hole, the more merging gold becomes the station.
Then the qualities, the generosity, the empathy, the giving and all of the sensitivity to others begins to happen without strings attached
A sign of this turn of the heart -- when 2s start giving themselves time to explore the things
 that are nourishing for their being and heart, vs
pattern there is a feeling of unworthiness and not investing in my own development
inner critic often says: there is a reason I am single; there is a reason my marriage is not working, and I am the reason - something about me makes me unworthy of love --> this is not the same as just sitting with the feeling of longing / bereftness.
love is not a commodity that can be changed. Love is something that we are
what if I cannot tolerate feeling this inner sense of aloneness and separation?
Feeling it doesnt make it 'true'. It's an illusion that If I feel my aloneness then that will prove that I really will be alone.
Titration
(sometimes mothers, who themselves are getting merging gold from their child, resist that separation. Kids -> do not want to have anything to do with the merging, fear sense of self is going to be completely overwhelmed)
Sandra: in the middle of the symbiotic period my mother left for a while. I was separated so that union was broken. Revisits the hurt of that rupture -- as mature adults we can digest experiences that for us as an infant were intolerable.
Modalities --> nervous system, somatic tools etc --> to heal this trauma
For students who have great difficulty contacting their felt sense, their physiological sense --> might be some trauma circuit operating, so that they can reengage the beautiful body system. I do not think of trauma work as something separate from spiritual work. For me it is part of the whole journey.

Exercise
Pairs
Those listening are being silent, neutral witnesses, sensing themselves and being present, paying equal attention to themselves and to the speaker. No encouragement or discouragement in posture or words, just open attentiveness that helps the person feel held and supported to explore.
The speaker is also sensing themselves and exploring their experience with immediacy  -- allow yourself to be spontaneous!
10 mins - then switch over.
Question #1: Tell me a way you feel disconnected from others... "I feel disconnected..." "Thank you" repeat question
Question #2: Tell me a way you feel lonely, alone, and unloved. 
15 minutes - looping back and forth
Question #3: Tell me a way you experience merging love

Point 1 - Brilliance
Anger
There is an aggression against what is in ones based on the standards in their minds of
how things should be. Should is a very big word for ones (an evaluation of how things are and a preference for something else)
Super-ego / inner critic --> important to get to know it!
every Enneatype has a Super Ego -- implicit in every healthy personality structure
but 1s is very identified with it, more than the other types ... Ones often have a big problem discriminating who they are from that voice that's judging, criticising -- It feels like I am the superego.
I am hesitant to even look at it because so much of my identity has been wrapped up in trying to get it right.


When you come from inner critic, We are leaking that frustration. We are leaking that annoyance... you actually have some good things to bring to people but with this unconscious pattern it makes me a bad
messenger. I do not deliver it in a way that people can receive it and people do not feel my care for them
Ego ideal --> collection of standards is the basis of our superego’s actions, judgments. It is an inner picture or a script of how things ought to be
a set of programs running in your mind.
it is historic, and impossible to meet (often there are contradictions)
messages we got from important authority figures when we were growing up.
they want actually to be perfect. The ego ideal is an attempt to be more and more in accordance with their vision of what perfect is.
But, everyone has different standard of what is the best, what is right even though each one takes it to be the gospel
for ones, get anxious that I am trying to hold the world together and it is falling apart --> moving away from the ideal starts to feel like a catastrophe! distorts our sense of reality in ways that are very painful (they care a lot!)
Sometimes not a voice -- just a feeling, e.g., suddenly anxious,
often shows when we are really getting close to the exit of our ego patterns, it will just make us shutdown. Suddenly we are tired, sleepy
Rubber band effect -- we start to break out from beyond the constraints of our inner patterns of our fixation, our superego gets busy trying to pull us back in -- i.e. when our consciousness expands, it tends to contract again
Perfectionism
The bias of their instinct, their subtype will color that
when I am in the fixation of one, that area I am focused on will get a lot of my attention -- but over focus on it to the point that some other areas of my life start to suffer - e.g., so focused on their cause
Animal = the dog (when ones have a bone to pick, they chew on it, and chew on it, long after the whole difficulty has gone by)
They are supposed to be perfect -- based on their inner picture of perfection, covering all the basis of our super-ego's demands, fulfulling all the standards we have of ourselves
Relaxing -- can feel as though they are letting the ideal down in their mind. Like they are betraying their parents, or authority figures by relaxing
Growth
a deeper intelligence comes into work and kind of reformats things, and in that moment,  I can respond instead of react.
we are not trying to GET RID of superego -- as long as we have ego structure, we have it. Wisdom is learning how to deal with it in a skillful way to not be triggered, not immediately responding to its voice
we need to learn in our own soul not to go with that voice, not to hate it,
Superego - It's trying to help us. The standards that our superego is asking us to meet is what it feels is in our best interest.
Myth - just because you are not in a good place does not mean that your superego has been active.... Super-ego characterised as judgmental
Gurjeff -> the inner critic is a stand in for what he called conscience. Conscience is a heart intelligence not yet fully formed in a young child, so you are guessing
Exercise
Repeating Questions:
Question #1: Tell me a way you experience your superego.  
Question #2: Tell me a standard that your superego holds you to.  
what is the ego ideal for you? the ideal inner picture, your superego pushes you to conform to?
Question #3: What would it do for you to fulfill your superego’s standards?.
what is the dream? why is it important to fulfil this standard? (positive intention)
(notice -- if you think you already know what you're gonna get out of doin this, maybe it's your super ego?)
1- Essence of intelligence
As we lose contact with the ground of Being, we also lose contact with that particular
differentiation of True Nature. What is left is a kind of intuitive or unconscious movement in the soul to
recapture that quality.
this particular differentiation of True Nature is very unique

It is the essence of intelligence. It is brightness itself. It is luminosity. The felt sense of brilliancy is of brightness. Light- it covers all the colors of the rainbow. It differentiates into all the colors of the rainbow.
Unlike other aspects, it contains all aspects. --> for the functioning of our intelligence, all of
 the qualities of Being are necessary -- We need our compassion. We need strength. We need will., Power, Openess of mind
Intelligence then contains and is all of those in the functioning presence that appears in different ways in our lives depending on which center it is coming through.

Synthesizing, penetrating mind -- reflects the quality of brilliancy itself. It penetrates into all of the components
brilliancy, when it is functioning, sees things purely just as they are.
The standards of the superego are gone
1s have a tendency to emulate the purity that is part of the presence of brilliancy itself.
Purity -- there is a sense of innocence. Real intelligence can penetrate to the truth of how things are and see them as they are
Wherein the wisdom that we seek does not come from our historic learnings -- from the implicit intelligence of the universe
Centres
When brilliancy is flowing in the heart center, it gives us emotional intelligence. we see all of the components of what is going on in a relationship
The intelligent heart responds rather than reacts. Knowing how to just be even in very difficult situations and to intelligently respond
When brilliancy is functioning through the belly center, it gives our actions and our functioning a sense of smoothness, ease --tai chi  --> intelligence about space
Beauty is very much connected with brilliancy.
1s desire to take things to the highest level is really an attempt to bring forth the preciousness of Being
Because brilliancy contains all of the qualities of True Nature, there is a sense of completeness about it, a sense of wholeness --> "I am complete" "perfect just as I am" --> this is what 1s are after
NOT perfection according to some standard but according to just being what I am and containing
 everything that is precious. I feel at peace with myself and inherently perfect.
there is no inner picture of how things have to be. The mind, the body, the soul is flexible and open
cannot be fundamentalist.
human beings are meant to find our right relationship between heaven and earth. We are part of the functioning of the body of the universe."
"my job is to create a vehicle worthy of music coming through me"
Integrity - all the elements are here. it is a wholeness where all of the components of the  wholeness are in their correct and intelligent placement.
How to access Brilliancy?
Explore our beliefs about the absence of perfection and rightness in our lives...
How we tend to see wrong, what we judge to be wrong and incorrect, and then pushing against whatever that is with wanting it to be different, with an inner no, with the anger
Get in touch with the absence of the sense of perfection within ourselves --> hole of brilliancy
explore our personal relationship to intelligence to find out whether we feel that we have it or we lack it. If we feel that we lack it, how come? What is that about?
Very common for us to have some blockages, barriers and issues around our sense of our god given intelligence - that we dont believe we have it

Wisdom vs intelligence --> Wisdom is the application of intelligence, intelligence brought to some useful response to a need, a situation
Judgements are continually happening when our brilliancy is operating (discernment) -- BUT If there is reactivity that goes with it and you are being judgmental about it, then you are getting into the fixated
Exercise
15-minute Monologue Topic:
Explore your relationship to intelligence. How have you tended to define it? Is it something you feel you have or feel you lack? In what ways do you experience your own intelligence and in what ways do you experience your lack of it? 
We are not talking about IQ - lots of different ways intelligence operates (functional, emotional etc.). Where do you rely? vs have doubts?

Point 3 - Personal essence
threes do not always look like fast-track business people. They
are not always slick. They will reflect the values and the epitome of whatever their cultural group is
We end up seeking to reflect that which is valued,
Most of us do not realize how much we are driven by a need to become the one who would be worth
respecting, worth loving, worth esteeming. Few of us sit down and breathe, and sense, and feel the glory
and beauty of who and what we are naturally.

IN striving to be the kind of person I am supposed to be, there is an ongoing unconscious self-rejection.
In a sense, the three child is trying to redeem the family shame by becoming that which the family felt was lost or unavailable
So, a family sad about their poverty, who is
going to become successful at finance and make money? A family could not get education? Guess who is
going to get a degree from a prestigious university.
(The Drama of the Gifted Child)

it never works because even if we succeed, if we become that great athlete, if we become that financial success, if we become that artist, we become that well-educated, brilliant intellectual, whatever it may be, our parents are at best going to have mixed feelings about that. On one hand, they are proud and grateful, but it can also exacerbate their sense of inadequacy

as long as we are under that spell, we work our butts off, and we do not even know why. We have goals and we do not know where we got them from. This is all very unconscious in people. We are following scripts that we do not know that we have.
"If you just do this you will feel great
about yourself. If you just do this you will be sexy. If you just do this, people are going to like you. If you
just do this, you will be set for life."
We are here to do something -- but the most fundamental things that we are here to do is to grow a soul, to mature our soul, to blossom as a certain possibility of True Nature -- what our heart feels truly called to
--> not just fixing our ego self,

For threes --> There is a grief at the ways in which I innocently betrayed myself to become this person that I thought I was supposed to be.

When 3s have worked and worked and worked harder than anybody they know, and they actually succeed at the goals, and then they wake up, perhaps in a hotel room, and looking around they
just feel this profound emptiness because on some level we know there is something else that is
supposed to be here.
Sometimes they get mad when they realise they are living someone else's dream, -- but the skills you have acquired can be hugely useful. This was not a waste

We find restoration of the sense of meaning, the meaning of our life, the value of our existence --> this felt sense such that whatever my functioning may be, there is a beautiful flow to it. The sense of meaning is infused into the doing... I am not looking to the doing to give me a sense of value or approval from others
our functioning is more like a love offering. It is more like we do what we do out of a correct seeing and valuing of what we are
Ego ideal
threes are people who are always in a process of trying to become.
the personality trying to produce this matured humanity, something worthy of praise, very focused on being effective, efficient, competent
TRICK: 3s feel that their inner feelings were slowing them down from their becoming --> learned how to set their subjective feelings aside to get the job done
often will get in touch with their feelings when they are alone,
outgoing and could be very charming, presentable -- but can feel very isolated! once you have sort of disconnected from that core to get stuff done and to become who you think you are
 supposed to be it is hard to receive the love of others

Passion = Deceit (or is it more mental fixation?) --> Vanity better (narcissicsm)
= the need to have value recognition for the ego self at the expense of the core of what we are... where we give up the journey toward the truth of our heart for the sake of trying to be what we think the world expects
core is profound sense of emptiness - we become like an empty shell
underneath the surface, there is this tremendous doubt and doubt of my worthiness, that I am lovable
When we drop into Being the authentic self, the need for Credit relaxes. The joy is not in the credit.
It is in the functioning itself. It is in doing our good work on this planet

Deceit
We all make stuff important that is not important. We all give a lot of
our time and energy to things that do not feed our heart and soul. We agree that things are wonderful
even though internally and privately, we do not really think they are so wonderful.

Virtue of authenticity is rare...
truthfulness, and seeking the truth
eventually realizes the terrible cost of turning away from the truth of our heart

Imagine we have a scale and on one side of the scale we have the moments of the day we have spent focused on being, presence, connecting with our heart, vulnerably
connecting with others, that is all the moments of the day. On the other all the moments that day we tried
to look good, smell good, choose the right clothes, worry about our hair, worry that we say the right thing,
prove that we are competent at what we are doing,

When in the three fixation? "Being" sounds like laziness. I do not want to do that just sitting around.
But actually, threes discover that real doing can only proceed from being. Inhabited doing requires being
as threes get clearer about this, their work tends to come more from their love, and they are guided by what matters to them.
They find more meaningful work, and they become exemplars and inspirations
as threes get healthier, it becomes more obvious that they are heart types.
They have sense of more authentic self-worth, but they also enjoy helping other people find that.
7 and 3s often mixed up
Sevens and threes are both outgoing, extraverted, doing stuff, and so forth. But threes are fiercely goal driven. I will do things that I do not particularly like to get to the goal
Sevens are more experience driven

Question #3: Tell me a way you experience being personal. 
maybe here the layers unfold..

Pt 4 - personal identity
Diamond approach - there is a certain soul identity
Concocting identity
the four is not vague about their identity, in a sense they are over-determining their identity on an egoic way, always trying to be a particular person as a kind of reaction to the underlying largely unconscious sense of not being who I really am.
the four is really going an extra mile to be individual, to be different, to be original.

there are these deeper, richer, melancholic feelings that are more complex, that feel
closer to the soul, feel more real. I am trying to be myself, so I am going to veer in that direction
-->sense of longing, feelings of melancholy, feelings of disappointment, those feel real and then I start to unconsciously create them, make sure they are around

Identity has a feeling tone. It is a way that you feel like yourself
"everyone has an atmosphere"
Ego is trying to create an atmosphere, a sense, a feeling tone of ourselves
Our mood becomes almost like scuba gear that we are taking around breathing our own atmosphere and trying to sustain the sense of a feeling tone that feels like the authentic self
Fours resist suppressin feelings -- They are not so interested in those elements of
 society, and they can actually judge them as inauthentic

Process of individuation keeps going -> we are kind of chronically differentiating ourselves... I am not like my sister. I am not like my mother (In point of fact, we might be quite like them.)
I am really always trying to see how I am not like others, how I do not fit in
Taste is a big deal for fours. Like/dislike very big --
one of the signs that we are kind of getting closer to essential identity is when we become more aware of beauty. When we into the deeper, essential nature of ourselves so to speak, we will tend to experience the world and self and others as more beautiful.
Vs when ego hyjacks, I use my taste of whats beautiful support for my sense of self, heightened attachment to our likes and dislikes in point four.(attempt to construct my identity and uniqueness)
Clinging to narratives -- I am a traumatized person. I am someone who was abused. I am who
 experienced this or that
4s cling to this --  image here of realness, an image of authenticity, an image of uniqueness.

But Taste paints us into corners. We have narratives, moods, are unconscious ego activities that are going on and on and on to keep this sense of being a certain person in place.

Desire for Authenticity
Ego melancholy -- sense something is missing in me. Something is absent
Envy - there is a sense that other people have it.
Ency's core is chronic disappointment. It is like sighing. Here we go again....
disappointment comes from the fact that in trying to compensate for this lack of being seen, I
 create a self-concept and it has certain idealizations in it. But when I set up this ideal self-concept, this totally creative, sexy, brilliant, amazing, spiritually evolved person, all of the above right, then it is setting up a kind of disparity between that and my actual lived life. Guess what? I end up rejecting and judging my regular lived life. I am a disappointment because I am thinking I should be the next Bob Dylan
Envy does not let you win! The envy itself
becomes the sense of my identity. You see. So, if it stops, who am I? What am I? If I am not in some
reaction to someone or something, including me, who am I? So, we locate ourselves through our
reactivity
As one of the image types tend to style themselves and take on qualities of others that they think are embodying realness or uniqueness or a sense of specialness.  --> tendency to appropriate different behaviors, attitudes, and styles from other people who they think have it.
fours are sometimes very eager to be hateful -- The heart of their suffering is that there is a rejection of self.
as though True Nature has abandoned me, which we project as mother or ea
ongoing sense in four of abandonment and the assumption that other people are abandoning them, are leaving them, are rejecting them,rly caretaker (but 4s are actually doing that to other people...)
Isolating tendency - it is very self-protective -- "I am so sensitive, and I am so vulnerable that
 being around you, crass, gross people is really difficult for me
loss of a real sense of who we are, and then an attempt to get it. Often this gets projected onto another who looks like they have it
fours often are in serial relationships -- "I want it it! I want it! > have it > I dont want ti anymore
There is a longing for intimacy. And really, that is a distorted longing for intimacy with self.
once they get that the game is over, so they have to keep longing -- it's the basis of their ego identity -- "I am someone who is left, who others dont love"

Something about people who are very emotionally dramatic is paradoxically, they are not really feeling, they are emoting (The cure for that is to really feel what it is that you’re dramatizing,)
emoting / discharging -- They are putting it out instead of really taking it in.

Fours probably invented the term spiritual bypass -- They do not like people just jumping over the moon

Suffering
4s absolutely convinced that, first of all, that they suffer more deeply than other people suffer, and that they feel more than other people actually feel
I am way more sensitive; thus, I am deeper
They are not more unique. They are definitely not more special. But they cling to those qualities to give themselves a sense of self.
All types edit their feelings in some way --> Fours are suspicious of positive feelings. They might be phony.
Coaching --> Comparison is part of the engine of envy. When you compare, when you are looking at human suffering, comparison is pretty useless. Who is suffering more?
When we let go of the comparison, being willing to be with the suffering in this world, you start to see it in others, and it becomes part of an opening to intimacy and connection
Victim -- being done TO me, rather than fully owning things that one is seeing in the other that are part of oneself.

You can't really help other people until you've become intimate / feel the suffering, learn to go through it. --> is not so easy for fours. It requires owning a lot of what gets projected by fours onto others

Need to face the victim image --
Person who left me -- tendency that tjhey dont ask, What was it that I did?
Because trying to stave off ruthless attacks by superego... Fours are hesitant to ask that question because a vicious inner critic superego is waiting
very painful - there is a feeling that there is something evil or poisonous about me at the core. --> you do not want to get too close to me or else I will contaminate you
do see a lot of fours who try to look happy on top of the melancholy -- happy facade...

How we take ourselves to be these patterns is both why we feel bereft, why we feel lost, why we feel hurt, but also why we defend so fiercely these patterns that are ultimately self-defeating, because we really think that this is me

Working with envy
Ask: how the other is better than how I am, or what they have it is better than what I have. To really explore where that judgment is coming from is
to recognize this is an evaluation. This is a mental determination that maybe is not real. And also, when
you are doing that, you are pushing away what you have and who you are and to try to understand that.
Why am I doing that? What is behind that? What is so terrible about what is here? You probably can
come up with all kinds of reasons why what is here is so terrible. But to look at that with an open mind,
with a sense of disidentification from it. Really, is what is here so terrible?

Grwoth
really letting yourself feel the ways in which you turn away from yourself and try to become something that looks better, seems better,
regardless of our enneagram point, it is very weird and very difficult to just absolutely sit
in the okay-ness of ourself. That we are lovable. --> For fours, this is kind of exaggerated

Alternating Questions:
Question #1: Tell me a way you try to be unique.
Question #2: When you’re doing that, what are you really wanting?
Repeating Question:
Question #3: Tell me a way you are unique.


The point
when we realize our essential identity, lights go off inside our consciousness.
Understanding that I am True Nature, is a big transition from simply having openings and peak experiences in which our consciousness expands and we have moments of grace in which we experience True Nature directly. --> transition from having spiritual experiences to actually knowing ourselves as spirit such that these are not simply experiences that I am having. 
each of us is an entryway, a portal into the totality of the realm of Being, the totality of the realm of Being exists in my consciousness. I am a microcosm of that macrocosm

It solves the problem of who am I? What is my identity? --> simple. pure: what I am is unconstructed, unfabricated in contrast to our personality structure (which is essentially a mental construct) - it feels real when we believe it is who we are - virtual reality is full of images)

takes a lot of inner work to get that the sense of being empty, the sense of lack, the sense of deficiency, there being something hateful about me, the painful well as positive beliefs we have are all mental constructs -- images that have collected in our nervous system
awakening of the point = getting I am not this ego structure. My ego structure is a collection of
 impressions from the journey that my soul has been on since I came into existence as this particular embodiment, but it does not define me.
And that this flow of consciousness that has been with me for my entire existence, is a manifestation of True Nature.
The need to be seen, the need to be mirrored, the need to be acknowledged as special -- all ways of shoring up our egoic sense of reality
Oh my god, I am Being! Not this original creative person (fabrications) --> The extent
that we do not know that leaves a gap in our consciousness, in our soul
to arrive at our essential identity, we need to allow that gap between ourselves and what we ultimately are.

Decades of work until our knowingness of who and what we are is more identified with Being and less identified with our personality structure
in Diamond Approach, we dont teach this until many years of work loosening up dientifcation with ego structure
Once the point becomes stable in our consciousness (once our knowingness that who we are is Being becomes more and more of a constant) --> There is less and less of a need to compare ourselves to other people.
We get that what we are is a unique spark of the divine. There is an inner knowing and a peace and a settled-ness that comes from abiding in our uniqueness.
there is less and less self-reflection, less mirroring ourselves back to ourselves. (Narcissicm) - where we seek validation of our self-images from others
we recognize that the source we have been looking for, the depth, the sense of profundity is this, it is Being. we really get that what I am looking for is here. It is inner. It is in my own consciousness.  (That takes a lot of not getting from the outside, lot of disappointments)
When we are authentically who we are, there is no need to be seen as that. There is no need for adulation.

essential identity is described, as it is in some of the spiritual traditions, as an inner experience of being a star. Eventually as it stabilizes, the experience becomes more and more real inside of us that I am the Divine, we become that star (that doesnt need fans)
--> why we're fascinated by stardom;  It is a reflection of each of our longing to be a star in our own right,
Originality is so important --  Original is made up of the word origin, --> when we are being truly original, we are manifesting what is our source, what is the origin of what we, and what everything else, is.
4s --> my emotional reaction or response to something is as important and probably
sometimes more important than the experience itself.

Stillness
Four in fixation is not about neutrality
As we drop in closer through presence, we come to more of a quiet, more of a stillness,
We are used to keeping
ourselves distracted from these issues by whatever dramas we have going on in our life. Whatever story
we are embroiled in, we are just constantly hypnotized by the ups and downs of our lives.
Holy Origin.
the closer we are in our sense of what we are, true origin, the more we are living as the point, It is not that I am a person who has creativity. I am creativity. My whole existence, all gestures, how I drink my tea, how I speak with my friend while we are having tea. All of it is perceived and experienced as the creative gesture of origin.

The Point vs The Pearl
The pearl is the living of what I am.. The expression of what I am in interaction with life, interaction with the world, in the doingness
The point is the realization of what you are --> the classical, spiritual enlightenment. The pearl emanates from that.
The core of the pearl is the point. I am Being  --> Your pearliness cannot be authentic unless it is coming from us as Being... And the realizations will just keep unfolding.

Pt 7 - pleasure vehicle
One of the characteristics of egoic consciousness is this inability to land. We skitter. We go from this to that , living off of a certain kind of momentum that kind of keeps us motivated, keeps us going.
Core = is this sense of an inner deficiency that will be fixed by something out there - We get the right job. We acquire that yummy object, right relationship, go on holidays..
it is of surviving, a way of managing my experience
survival strategy - coping with awful childhood, "down the road it will be better" --> but you are always down the road. You are always looking at something else.
Ego ideal here is happiness, delight, satisfaction
but, I'm striving for some kind of deep and abiding satisfaction. --> I am meant to have some kind of abiding fulfillment, delight, satisfaction, all these things
But seven in me wants this openness, this spontaneity, this lightness -- freedom
striving for feeling up, feeling good, feeling okay
Forward momentum -- root is anxiety
Being an enneagram seven does not give you a get out of jail free card from human suffering -- but they put on a show, not worry about me. Everything is good here, What is out there next? When is that?
Passion = Gluttony for experience.
beneath, we hit a layer of anxiety, and below that a layer of emptiness.
Trying to fill myself up through external stimulation and experience
gluttony, relates to a Buddhist idea of the hungry ghost -- is a part of the human soul that is almost like an empty sack that is trying to be filled.
inner aridity: 2s and 4s - uicy, emotive, heartful sort of emptiness -- but 7s have dry kind, this inner aridity they are trying to take things in order to moisten, to make this desert inside spring to life.
Ego-plan: really trying to understand how do I get fulfillment, how does this all work, what is the grand plan that is going to take me to the oasis where there is nourishment??
the core of being a seven is that you are distant from your heart. The heart has suffered.
The strategy is to look out there -- . I am going to take something in that is going to make me feel, that is going to make me come alive, come awake
many spiritual teachers who come up with visions of how it all works, how reality functions... but it is a substitution for feeling what is happening inside of me and trusting my natural unfoldment
"sevens have been sucking on a dry tit growing up and not getting the juice"
gluttony is about taking in what the outside world has to offer, what others have to offer in an attempt to bring this desert to life inside
the impulse is to go out, to go away, to move away from pain.
Traits
They do not have a lot of trust of other people. There is a sense of I need to take care of my own needs -- something in the seven soul that is very sensitive to that that picks up shortcomings.
I am not going to depend on other people to get my needs meant. I am going to make sure I am happy
I am going to make sure I have a good life and I am going to make sure I am free. W
But what I am really looking for here as a seven is a satisfaction in the heart -- not just of a transient little happiness or excitement
For the ego, freedom is having options, having more choices
the more I am driven by this anxiety the more I feel trapped. The more I feel like I do not have this freedom, I will insist on options
what traps me as a seven because I go round and round and round, and it never lands anywhere. I never choose anything. The rolling stone gathers no moss. That can be a tragic thing.
do not always stick with it to the point that it brings that fulfillment, again out of the fear of losing freedom. What if I should have been doing that?
the ego is not quite trusting that what is coming up with its substitute version of that which you know may have some thrills and spills here and there, but keeps coming up short in terms of what my heart is really after
a lot of sevens in the spiritual journey partly, I think, out of this knowing that we are meant to have bliss

Fixatiion = planning (more , anticipating)
Sevens value spontaneity. When they are not so present that spontaneity degenerates into impulsivity which is escapism and avoidance
anticipating, thinking about the future
We are so swept into this slip stream of wherever we think we are going, that we fail to ever be where we are --> if I am not present, very little of the nourishment, the nutrition of the experience will get to me
, the fulfillment we are seeking is an inside job. The fulfillment and the inner freedom, both are properties of presence itself
t if I am present and breathing consciously and I am actually in the moment, my soul starts to receive as impressions what it needs for its development which shows up as learnings, as realizations
The soul is starving. Our human society, our civilization is starving because we are not taking in the impressions of our existence and of each other and of our inner life. So, if you think of it that way, the seven is ultimately an invitation to remember, taking in the impressions of my inner life, which will bring with that the sense of this satisfaction and freedom.

Outward energy
There is a deep knowing in sevens. Goodness is out there. Freedom is out there. I am going to figure out how to get there. You know I am going to take a course. I am going to learn in a weekend how to figure this all out.. Then, of course, I can turn around and help other people get there too.
Sevens are great students and they are also great teachers.
Instead of deeply diving in and fully digesting a subject, the tendency energetically is out. Put it out, find it outside, put it outside, you know, express the wisdom that I have gained
Joseph Campbell did this amazing synthetic work of mapping all of the world's religions and spiritual beliefs and coming up with this grand overview in which everything fits together --> this deep thirst to understand how it all works.
Of course, that attempt is based on not trusting what is going to unfold naturally
Heart tends to be the weak link for sevens --> a shutting down to suffering and moving into the mind to try to figure out how am I going to resolve this

Impatience
wrecks a lot of happiness for point 7s. Impatience with process. impatience with myself a lot.
We can imagine it - but dismiss that getting there might take a little longer. But there is that expectation of getting there instead of loving the process and it could take time
I should already be there
-->creates this sort of background of frustration, agitation, and impatience
try to become instant experts on things
can envision the oasis and therefore why cannot I be there?

Heathly sevens --> my brilliance and every addition and knowledge about life in the world starts to be in service of people's healing and happiness. Not just my happiness and my freedom and my fulfillment. It is about our freedom, our fulfillment
healthy 7s are not afraid of sadness or depression
you know your light is real when it can shine in the darkness.
Exercise
something powerful happens when we share a truth about ourselves or our journey in community.
Prompt #1 (clockwise): “A way I try to make myself happy is….”
Prompt #2 (counter-clockwise): “I have found deep satisfaction in…”
This is not a monologue. You are giving a sentence or two
Be aware of wanting to make impressions:  is the answer coming from our egoic patterns and narcissism (giving clever answers), or from our presence?
Every time you take in impressions of what other people are sharing, it is going to work something deeper so that then your sharing comes from a place that is going to be a surprise for you too


each of the ennea-types is like a cornerstone of our ego structure. Their basic foundational orientations are universal whenever we have a personality structure
each diamond vehicle, (shorthand for different wisdom teachings) if you have the capacity for inner sight, contains the red, the white, the pearl, the point, merging gold, and all of the other qualities of our nature.
each wisdom teaching is a view, is an angle on realization... Each one is a path in and of itself toward oneness with our deepest nature and each one highlights different issues and different aspects about what the journey entails,

This vehicle which we call the Markabah - Markabah in Hebrew means chariot --> this vehicle takes us to realization through neither being motivated by fear of suffering nor by desire to feel better
often when we start our inner journey: wanted to be happy. I wanted to feel better. I was very miserable, very depressed,
at some point our motivation needs to shift if we want to truly become one with what we are in the depth of our consciousness.... A lot of what we run into inside of ourselves is not pleasant. We have pockets of undigested material. We have holes in our soul
This vehicle, this understanding is all about turning toward ourselves --> this is challenging because we're wired to avoid unpleasure and move toward what is pleasurable.
all of those pleasures of infancy came from the outside...
Markabah if we see it visually, is a vehicle that rotates, that is continuously turning and that turning represents and embodies a turning toward. A turning toward what is sitting here in our location in time and space because that is the only way we access True Nature. It is not out there.
the teaching of the Markabah is that if we truly want to be whole, if we truly want to abide in the truth of what we are, we are only going to find it here.
Realization does not happen any place except right here. So, the turning that the Markabah represents is a turning away from our hardwired tendency to look outside of ourselves for goodness, for pleasure, for delight -- and to avoid what doesnt feel good
We discover there is a kind of pleasure in being with the truth of our experience.
e.g. Let yourself have a good cry or let yourself really feel it -- t there is a pleasure to being with the truth of what is going on with us, s instead of trying to rise above it or escape it or make it go away.
The capacity to hang in with whatever is showing up on our plate is really the capacity that it takes for fruition of the inner journey.
7s - the joy latifa, the yellow quality of essence (original teaching) --> bigger,--> e yellow latifa is a heart-centered quality, the experience of joy or pleasure or bliss or goodness is something that we feel.
When we are with ourselves no matter what is arising, it feels good because it is the truth of our experience... we have to land in ourselves. We have to be here
When we get in touch with the ground of Being, nobody ever says this feels awful. This is a bad experience, right? Those experiences are always uplifting, enlivening or we feel inspired. It teaches us that the goodness of our nature, the positivity of our nature --> more fundamental than the suffering on the surface
7s tendency to be head-centered to try to figure out how to get to the oasis, how to get to what feels good, how to strategize, and I do not think we talked too much about this yesterday, how to strategize our unfoldment, how to get an idea of where we ought to be, and aught is a big word here for sevens
is not the way it works. The way it works is you have to stay with yourself
Understanding M does not mean that we do not enjoy external things
So rather than the delight residing in the flower or in the music, those things are helping us to connect to the delight that is inherent, implicit in what we are. Each of those particular embodiments is simply expressing the pleasure, the bliss, the goodness of our nature.
To connect with M
if you work at developing concentration on the kath --> Samadhi , f peacefulness, a sense of openness, a sense of oneness. It all feels good.

In a nutshell --> the satisfaction and fulfillment is not created by the content of experience but by the quality of our presence and attention in any experience we have.
in egoic consciousness we tend to split pleasure and pain, joy and sadness
As move toward this deeper realization, they are not at odds anymore
It is the positivity, this quality that helps us be with those difficulties without being overwhelmed by them
If I start getting present with myself, I am going to run into what I might judge as unsavory aspects of myself,
realization when I am with the truth of my experience, it is a movement into liberation. I am getting free from something I was identified with, something that I was avoiding, something I was believing in.
When we see through the structures, and we are actually finally able to be with the suffering that has driven so much of our behavior .., it is like a breakthrough
We feel good because we are getting free, and it is our inherent nature as conscious souls to be free.--- 7 teaches us how we mistake all kinds of things for freedom that are not the real thing
e teachings of Sufism, teachings of Gurdjieff is that when we do not see what is going on, we are in a prison that we do not recognize. We are in the prison of our egoic consciousness
So deep in our heart is this wish for liberation, opening, relief, freedom, bliss.
Freedom is pleasurable. We want to be free because it feels good.
When you are in some kind of emotional or physical difficulty, there has been some big disappointment, some big difficulty, if you come back to yourself in those moments it is actually easier in an odd way to notice this quality of presence
this Markabah pleasure, this element of seven, is that it brings appreciation. When things are going our way, we do not take our life for granted. We do not take our health for granted. We do not take the relationships in our life for granted. Everything feels like Wow!
we are more gracious and compassionate, and able to be with the suffering and difficulties of this world.
. The Markabah, and this sense of what real pleasure is about and the soul’s movement toward that real sense of liberation and pleasure and satisfaction is what helps us go through what we need to go through. It helps us take the medicine we need to take.
We are going against a lot of conditioning, individual and collective... , and a lot of beliefs that we cannot tolerate the dark places, the painful places

Growth
ONE way through = allowing the sense of not feeling not pleasure. The sense of unpleasure within your experience and not being afraid of it, working through what it is. In order to not be afraid of it, you have to explore why you are afraid of it.
What are you afraid is going to happen if you let yourself feel your disconnection from an inner sense of pleasure. What is going to happen to you? they are beliefs. They are not the truth.
When you take that leap of faith and you let yourself feel what feels awful to you, you will see that you can survive it. In fact, it can open up and reveal what it was obscuring
theory of holes = where we are disconnected in our soul from the ground of Being there are these experiences of absence
From the perspective of the Markabah, they feel like an absence of pleasure, an absence of happiness. They feel like deficiency
so turning toward them rather than away from them whenever they arise in our consciousness is one of the ways of accessing the Markabah.
The other way is by looking at and sincerely feeling and exploring what your allegiance is to, what are you devoted to. Are you more devoted to pleasure? Or are you more devoted to truth, to finding out who and what you fundamentally are?
Ask throughout the day: What am I more devoted to right, to feeling good or to being with what is
in psychology was called anhedonia, the absence of pleasure. If you notice that all egos have some element of that because we are detached from the felt sense of our being from which we would derive pleasure. If you do that, you are going to start to see your habits and what we are all grasping after -->one of three poisons in Buddhism is grasping.

Exercise Questions:
Question #1: Tell me a way you don’t land in yourself.
Question #2: What’s right about not landing in yourself?
(I do not want to be here. It is scary.)
Question #3: What’s it like to land in yourself?
(, I am noticing right now that I feel really good inside,)
Repeating questions.

Type 9
The external directedness of 99.9% of humanity is like being sleepwalkers, and it is universal.
there is always a sense that something is missing, something crucial, something fundamental. So, people of this ennea-type have a deep sense at the core of deficiency -- "I came in with some of the parts missing."
For nines the tendency is to feel less than, to feel worthless in comparison to others, having less value.
in the childhood of nines I have seen that there tends to be another sibling or a parent who took inordinate attention in the family --> sense develops that I am not important, that there is no reason to give attention here.
9s cover up that very, very painful inner sense of lack and deficiency through their ego ideal which is comfort -- there is an attempt in nines to numb it (pain) out, to deaden to it
Comfort
They do not like the boat rocked. They do not like situations that are unharmonious. They do not like situations that are challenging
Attempting to pacify the waves of turbulence because it is so challenging for them to experience them, because then they might have to experience their own inner turbulence.
Nines are great at numbing out what is going on inside.
nines stop listening to themselves. They tune out what they are feeling. Sometimes what they are thinking, what their opinions are, they are much more likely to concede an opinion to somebody who is much more forceful
mediator: They are very good at getting what is going on with other people, at seeing different points of view. The challenge for nines is seeing their own point of view, not minimizing it, not pushing it away but actually listening to it
neglect themselves often in order to take care of others and to make things comfortable for others, especially those they really care about and love
9s vs 2s
2s- about being there for others, but with the sense of hey, look at me! Look how much I am getting there for you
9s - it is just a very kind of selfless self-sacrifice, a great deal of difficulty tuning into what is it that I really need and what is it that I really need to do
Distraction / procrastination
chaos is one of those things that characterizes lots of nines. She got completely involved in straightening up the desk for over a week until she had completely exhausted herself and forgotten why it was that she had started to do in the first place. So, there is that kind of tendency in nines to get distracted by all of the peripheral stuff and having a real difficulty tuning in to what is essential,... Specifically, what do I really need? What do I need to attend to?
Most of us have a tendency push away the difficult stuff that we have to attend to in life whether it is a confrontation with someone, just feels like it is going to take a lot of energy and just feels really unpleasant.
Self-neglect
tend to neglect their bodies, their physical needs. They tend to neglect their personal needs and the needs of others become much more of a priority than their own.
Ego-ideal -- I am comfortable
s, they have a memory of where they have been which is in a state of peace, in a state of ease, in a state of security, of harmony and with the really deep trust in reality itself. Once we are not in touch with the ground of Being, we inevitably lose all of those qualities. We lose most fundamentally a sense of trust in how things unfold. We lose a sense of trust in reality.
the peacemaking tendency of nine is an attempt to reconnect to the sense of peace that is possible for us
passion here is laziness
Laziness = inertia for us as human beings is the principle of hanging in with the status quo, staying with the familiar,
e.g., this manifest in many people's lives is staying in a difficult situation when you know the best thing for you is to get out of i
--> more common is nines who have a million plates spinning in the air, have all this stuff going on that they are trying to keep up with. That is deeply consuming, so consuming that they have no space or energy to pay attention to themselves
our inner in-touch-ness with True Nature, with Being, with the divine, is fundamental underpinning for everything else we do. Without it, everything we do is really just maintaining plates spinning in the air and keeping it all going. We keep it all going so we do not have to feel there is a lack here.
only reason to study the enneagram is to get a sense of what the patterns are so that you can get free of them. Not so that you develop a new and improved label for yourself.
the second step is waking up to what lies beyond our personality patterns

spiritual bypass
me saying all is one is not the same thing as...
We will gather in comfortable spiritual communities, and we will merge around certain sayings and teachings and will not disturb each other
Anger becomes very important from a certain sense in the inner work process... Anger is the energy of separation... No! --> for 9, it sort of wakes us up from our inertia. It is an activating energy
sadness here is a kind of collapse. It is kind of giving up. It is what many of us feel when we look at the difficulties in the world and go what can I do? It is a sense of overwhelm.
Heaviness - there are mechanisms in our psyche that move to protect us by shutting us down energetically as we start to approach the exit.

The problem is this falling asleep and taking this business as usual to be the final statement. Although I think the sadness is that there is some residue, something in us knows there is something more. Something in me remembers I come from a boundless land. Something in my heart knows I am actually, really, truly part of unity, but I have lost the way home so I have to make it here as best I can as an exile and just get through this world. Getting through it instead of living it.
Exercise Questions 

Question #1: Tell me a way you try to create comfort.
(for yourself? for other?)
Question #2: Tell me a way you forget yourself. 
(How do you tune out, neglect yourself?)
Question #3: Tell me something you don’t want to deal with  


Returning to normal is returning to fixation. Going back to normal is self-forgetting and assuming again an identity that is not necessarily the deeper truths of what you and I are. -- let the habits of our consciousness pop back into center stage.

we can look at all of the other points as refractions of this pure Being, pure consciousness
So 9 is what is here before it starts to discriminate into these different qualities and elements that we can see. It also, in a certain way, functions as a kind of a portal.
the essence of the essential quality of point nine is kind of the classic enlightenment experience. It is an experience of light, of like I saw the light.
, it is also the experience of love -- not love as attachment necessarily., It is love that brings planets and stars into being.... It is the divine love as the foundation that is producing all the possibility of life and experience that we have. As I said, in the purest versions of human love that can absolutely be there. It is also true that you can experience this when there is no one else around. You can experience it just sitting on a hillside or looking at the sky
t can feel like this kind of holding and support
It is what gives us the trust and the courage sometimes to take the leap into the unknown. Our ego is based in so many ways on the loss of trust, on the loss of holding.
We can see all enneagram points as created out of a loss of what he calls basic trust, a sense that somehow the universe is on my side despite the ups and downs of life., t I can trust, that I can relax, and that I can allow things to open
9s - there is some kind of benevolence, some kind of goodness out there, but it does not apply to me. I am somehow witnessing it, but not in it. Many nines have told me they go through life feeling like a guest, like I do not know if I belong here
realize oh, my gosh! This is what I am, too. It is not just a rumor. It is not just a spiritual formula to cheer me up. It is a direct experience. It is not just the experience of Being supporting me, it is the realization I am this Being.
you start to understand you can never really be without love
Love clears away all the scared resistance, reluctance and we land more and more deeply in the living moment. In that we become reconnected.
nines are most likely to see themselves in all nine types. They sometimes have a heck of a time finding their core point. We are landing on one and being not so sure that it is home base.
because nine so strongly identify with others. It is hard sometimes for us to locate ourselves.
spiritual
Enneagram is an understanding of the bridge between our psychological selves and ourselves as essential Being. So, you start to understand some of the conundrums of the personality when you see how they are an imitation or an efforting to return to certain states of Being.
boundless love is present when you can be with just about anything.
Okayness
personality of the nine in some sense is trying to restore that fundamental okay-ness but it is a different thing. On the level of the psyche, it is trying to do it by moving away from that which is conflictual or disturbing 
When we are coming at it more from this dimension of Being, of boundless love, this presence there is something that moves toward and holds our suffering, holds our fear, holds the difficulties and is there in the midst of the conflict. It gives us the capacity to show up and bring goodness and bring healing and bring mediation
less avoidance
With 3
when I am closer to this ground of Being, this holding quality of love, it kind of works beautifully with point three, that pearly quality and our functional self --> timelessness and flow a
, nine and this boundless love is what gives us the capacity to do this seemingly impossible spiritual task which is to be in the world but not of it --> returning again and again to the ground, the ground in ourselves, and letting that love restore our sense of trust so that we can let go more into the living truth of what we are
non-dual
we sort of tend to separate mind and heart in the way we look at spiritual tradition, but in this space of nine, the Being, the holding loving quality and the awareness are more all of one ground...  this is the gateway into nondual realization.

point 5 -
ego-stinge for ego stinginess, holding on
s the tendency to retain, to hold on to. To me, it is really an energetic holding on. So, fives tend to conserve their energy. They do not want to exert too much energy
tend to hold on to their inner life in particular. They are very private people and so what is going on inside, especially their emotional life, very rarely gets fully expressed.

deep connections with others, but they are going to be few and very, very far between and highly scrutinized before a five would even dream of really opening up to somebody else.
as you pull back from the outer world, you cannot help but pull back from yourself as well. This is one of the fear types
d hiding is another way of describing what this type does. You cannot help but hide from your deepest self and really the whole strategy of retention, of hiding, of isolating is a reflection of how we have pulled back and lost contact with our deepest nature.
f fives as scouts. They are looking at the terrain of their lives. They are looking at the terrain of relationship. They are also looking at the terrain of inner process to figure out in a mental way is it safe for me to fully experience this?
t onlooker’s stance that observing of what is happening, there tends to be an arrogance. There tends to be a sense of hmm! Look at those poor pleads who are so actively engaged in life. -- a compensation for being at a remove.
The withdrawal and the withholding that characterizes them is both their biggest defense and also their deepest form of suffering. The sense of aloneness, the sense of isolation and the resulting sense of emptiness that results from only having what is here -- leads to a kind of dry emptiness that is characteristic of the deficiency state 
Life is lived through the mind
There is an actual lack of experiential engagement and so the mental engagement becomes primary for fives.
Knowledge, understanding really getting what is going on out there, and also in here become crucial. Fives attempt to figure out and to understand
five tendency is, do I need to understand it more, know more about it?
for the five part of us it is never safe enough. We can never have enough mental knowledge for understanding about anything experiential that makes us feel safe enough to fully enter into it, because the knowledge and the understanding is not experiential.
a great accumulation of knowledge about what happened to us. But unless that knowledge becomes felt, becomes experiential, it does nothing to change us.
--> encouraging you to get into your felt experience not your storyline
This existential pain of feeling faintly existing... attempt to compensate for the impoverishment of feeling an active life through the intellectual life for which the individual is usually well endowed constitutionally and through being a curious and/or critical outsider
g a mental orientation, the individual may seek substitute satisfaction as in the replacement of living through reading
Another aspect is the preparation for life, a preparation that is intense to the extent that the individual never feels ready enough --> I end up in that preparation mode, like all my life is homework to get ready to live
What is going on out here? It is a scary world, can I get a handle on it? a profound lack of confidence in my ability to take a place in the world.
Tend to dwell in abstractions, while at the same time avoiding concreteness. This avoidance of concreteness in turn is linked to the type’s hiddenness.
Pulling away --not simply a withdrawal from negative experiences but also from positive experiences. u cannot psychologically take and choose what you are going to pull away from
very primal ego defense = schizoid detachment.
In the five temperament, there is this tendency to overwhelm, everything is overwhelming. It is like I was born without any boundaries
When somebody thinks they are holding me very lovingly, but they are inside in some hysterical state, they are in some kind of trauma, they are in some kind of difficulty, the baby picks up all of that. --> t just knows I am being merged with suffering, with pain, with overwhelm
, one thing I can do is contract. I can pull myself back from this overwhelming field of suffering.
So, baby contracts. ... It is like withdrawing into the crevices in my soul and I will not come out. And then that becomes the pattern I have become identified with
To take care of myself, I must not need. Particularly, I must not need anything from you, from other human beings, from mom and dad
characteristic is one of intense focus. I am not really dialing around with fifteen different things. Another way that retention shows up is they collect things.

Nines often mistake themselves for fives, because nines have a withdrawn quality.
contraction is that it also intensifies my energy because it is sort of under a jar.
nines when they are having difficulties and their defense mechanisms are kicking in, sloth makes us feel heavy, sleepy
Fives do not do that. It is more like being on fire and there is an intensity -- they dont get sleepy, they get insomnia, can't turn their minds off.. Fives have a strong imagination.
nines can look right back at another person and they are gone but for sure you do not feel judged or intimidated necessarily. There is a kind of openness. A point nine person gazes at you and meets you
Fives seem to peer like I am a praying mantis evaluating. Can I eat you? There is a way that fives and again, it is that internal intensity, comes out through the eyes. The other person does not feel that I am with them or for them but that I am peering at them, evaluating them, you know, scanning them
Starting premise - that the world is a dark place...
precocious awareness of mortality meaning even as little kids I am thinking about death.
there is a sense of almost wrestling with existential questions.
counterphobic movement toward looking at the disturbing and difficult questions of life. I do not seek to cheer myself up. I do not seem to comfort myself. In fact, I think if I do not handle these big scary things, I will never be ready to live in the world. (many horror writers!)

the salvation lies in contact -- presence equals contact. (we think going to destroy me, or it will destroy the concept I am identified with)
Contact with who, with what? Well, there is only one contact. I cannot be in contact with you if I am not in contact with me
I felt as if this whole detachment felt like a structure, like a shell, like a shield. It cracked and when it cracked that pain, existential pain... I just grieved. I grieved my detachment. Feeling it necessary. I was not beating myself up, but I absolutely knew I could never go back to that, and that I was going to have to keep risking being affected by everything.
Cutting off from Love is a lot of the grief. Living away from love is a difficult way to live
we are learning presence in our body because it gives us another ability to be affected without having to detach or go mental or get the heck out of ourselves.

Passion = avarice
fives in general are more willing to share knowledge than sharing anything else.
e, because I feel like I have accumulated a lot of knowledge, I can give some of that away. But what I do not give away is me, my heart, my inner life. It is that avoidance of contact...could be about money or resources, and things.
you think that eventually, if you know enough stuff, if you have enough skills, if you have memorized so many things, then you will finally know. You will finally know what is going on and be able to join the world
but Mind cannot take the place of our embodiment
...five on the higher side is an invitation to not be lazy about acquiring what you need to know for your journey.
Dissociation vs detatchment
dissociation  - you just leave, not aware
detach - you are kind of still aware, but you are not letting the feeling and sensation channel be on. The switch goes off
Eventually, though, it catches up with us. We cannot run forever.
Fear that the five is afraid of the outside world and flees inward. The seven is afraid of the inside world and flees outward. The six is afraid of both and is on a shuttle train between the two --> But they are all based really on a fear of direct contact, of immediacy with self, with different ways of coping with it.
5s --> this high, strong effect of anxiety. There is a kind of anxiety to the attention
as soon as we presence it, it can be transmuted into a kind of lucidity.
t a kind of fundamental awake-ness. When you are scared, you are not sleepy
indifference
I am indifferent to what you are talking about -->  kind of arrogant felt sense that people often have about five.
you may feel that a five is not paying attention to you. They are actually tracking everything that is happening, but they are withdrawn....You will not feel the person with you exactly


Five are the great innovators of the enneagram. ..Why not try it this way? Nobody has ever done it. Well, who cares? Let us give it a shot. So that experimentation and willingness to explore and willingness to go into the unknown
Exercise Questions 
Question #1: Tell me a way you maintain distance.
can be internal, external, whatever comes to mind, just let it be as spontaneous as possible.
Question #2: Tell me a way you substitute knowledge for direct experience.
Question #3: Tell me something you think you know.
we are differentiating between things we really know in our guts in a felt way vs mental knowledge
Notice when answering questions --> Sometimes it has historical stuff in it. Sometimes it is just completely in the now


realization itself is a kind of knowing. It is not a feeling although it has a feeling.
West - content of mind
East , Buddhism for sure, Taoism and certain elements of Advaita Vedanta, and so forth, mind is more with the capital M, and it has more to do with the ground, the space, the place in which the content of mind occurs

True mind is the antithesis of blurry. There is nothing vague about being awake. It is precise. It is clear. It is vivid. In the Diamond Approach we have the metaphor of diamonds.
As we start to see through our various beliefs and historic attitudes, and so forth, one of the things that happens is our heart gets more purified
In the same way our mind gets clarified. Now for a while that is going to look like finding a kind of quietude... profound solitude, where we are more accessible to the capacity of knowing... e fives just on a personality level are trying to get back there... --> turns into is the belief I need to be alone all the time
in some instinctual remote way remember what our essential home is like, what our true nature is like.
I need more and more isolation. I have to get away from everybody to hear myself think. But you might notice that if you coach a meditation retreat, or you go sit on top of a mountain and there is nobody there, you discover where the crowd is, and it is not out there. It is in your head.
n called direct knowing. The Greeks called this noesis.--> experiential knowing , "when not even a thought exists between you and the thing you know"

being interested is a heart quality. It means you care.
Diamond guidance is where the knowing is situated in a central way in my experience. But this diamond guidance can work with historic knowledge and experience and synthesize and bring forward exactly what is needed to open up the next stage of what I am seeking to realize
coming from like a third dimension that can see the whole chessboard and can see all the pieces, and from that can just pluck out kind of effortlessly whatever is needed to synthesize the realization of truth in that moment.
The problem is the pathway into diamond guidance is the path of realizing that we do not know anything... coming to that quietude of mind where we are kind of empty and receptive.


fives and fours, sitting at the bottom of the enneagram kind of are closer to emptiness than almost any other type. They feel a kind of ongoing existential emptiness. Now for the five, there is a kind of desire to keep emptying out content, get rid of things, get rid of relationships, get rid of crowds. Anything that distracts me, get rid of it.
Naranjo, and we had this notion that the top of the enneagram, the eight and nine and the one was the pull of Being and the bottom of the enneagram, where there is no point, is the pull of non-being, emptiness
5s -what we definitely are afraid of is an emptiness of mental content like to have nothing. In a sense, since I am identified with my thoughts, if there is nothing in my noodle, then I do not exist. So, there is a way that I keep my mind activated.
f seeing through the content that I am identified with that opens me to a kind of emptiness. It is from that that the element of this diamond guidance can start to grow and manifest and come through. --> connected with the black, which again has to do with power, but also has to do with emptiness non-being.
green essence. The compassion comes in because in the journey to truth we are going to find all the ouchy stuff that made us step out of the truth. We are going to feel our hurt. We are going to feel our traumas. We are going to feel our crushing disappointments
diamond guidance works in conjunction with all these different elements to bring exactly the ingredients we need in that moment to see what we need to see. Sometimes to articulate what we need to articulate or to do what we need to do, to move into the next stage of our liberation in our work in this world.
the guidance feels like something given to you and it appears mysteriously in your consciousness, not quite sure where it came from,... ego might want credit.. But you start to feel like you are receiving it
equivalent in the Christian tradition to the idea of the Holy Spirit
you will notice we tend to get quiet. It is not because we do not know what to say, although that is true, it is more like a quality of deepening the listening, deepening the receptivity, deepening the stillness and then I find, remarkably without fail, this guidance comes through
", what I needed to know appeared exactly when I needed to know it"
Phenomenologically, mostly people will experience it, as I said, around what we call the third eye
experience it sometimes as a sensation, sometimes it feels like an intensity. It can feel like a throbbing. Sometimes it tickles, actually
Sometimes you can experience it if your psyche, your soul is such that you tend to see things, it can be like this bright light that is illuminating everything from wherever it happens to be
it can be like this bright light that is illuminating everything from wherever it happens to be, often there. But everything else just becomes spacious with this light illuminating the space. S

Truth
the movement toward truth, to understanding the truth, to being informed by the truth is a movement of love -- t I actually experience that there is a loving quality to the power of this
Diamond guidance to me is like an inner gyroscope that points us toward what is the deepest truth in the moment, what is really going on
w for fives the preoccupation really is to figure out what is happening here and how can I participate in what is happening here
It is the faculty of our consciousness that allows us to let go of all prior beliefs, all preconceptions, letting go of what you already know -- Like in order to see what is really happening in the moment, emptying in your mind of all that content so that you can freshly see and experience what is happening here, what is happening outside of myself, what is happening inside of myself
e.g., if you are trying to understand what is going on with another person, to do that you have to let go of what you think is going on
even if it is somebody we know really well, like somebody we would live with, our minds have a filter or a veil that is made up of the history we have with that person. It makes it difficult to see what is actually happening with this person right now
We are not getting present to what is here and when we see what is here, things can start to fall into place.
being completely in the now includes all of the past. If our mind is open in such a way, it also includes the future and the potential of the future. -->
Buddhism of Alaya-Vijnana which is a storehouse for knowledge, for all the wisdom, where all the understanding of humanity is present.
the truth is, it is present all the time, we simply need to get quiet enough to let our minds function in such a way that they are perceiving the deepest truth
stillness allows the mind to open and to be receptive to perceiving what is actually here.
an experiential understanding of what is going on, what is the deepest truth here.
The practice of inquiry is a practice of putting into practice guidance, feeling into what is really true for me in the moment. What is beyond my pretense.
f being an onlooker, kind of a stranger in a strange land as it were, and trying to understand what is happening here.
Trust. there is a movement into trusting this deeper capacity of knowing that requires a little bit of trust
there is something amazing that happens in our heart in the moment that we see the truth even if it is a truth that at first seems a little bit like bad news. Like Oh, my God! I was a narcissistic maniac. Well, that is the liberating power of seeing the truth
the truth will set you free.
Something happens in our heart when you really see what that is. It is like there is no going back. Truth has got to you! spirit has entered your heart, and it is going to be a different journey now...
Almost all scientific discovery has this somewhere lurking in it
guidance also helps us figure out what is good nourishment, what is good stuff to learn
other things might be worth studying, worth knowing.
Example: Sometimes we can sense when a person is lying
dialogue with a person, and you are open to really seeing what is going on with them. You notice the person is really contriving to look intelligent --> That is the guidance operating
We can feel the artifice in others. We can feel the passions if you are familiar with the passions in the enneagram, you can feel them operating in people
OR you're mad at someone, prepared angry speech -- if you actually feel into who that person is and what is happening there in the real moment, all these sorts of angry speeches you have prepared go right out the window. Something else that you do not expect comes out of your mouth and you communicate to that person in a way that opens up another possible connection
t the articulation, how you need to be, how to dance with that person
line to 8 - you need that eight energy, aliveness, and immediacy that brings the contact.

Vs Intuition
: Is this different from intuition? The answer is yes
Guidance is a direct knowing -- guidance helps us open up the understanding of the intuition
Sometimes we have intuitions, and we cannot track where they came from. We do not understand what led to this, that can be the beginning of the breadcrumbs. It helps you get into the full revelation of what you are seeing 
intuitions can come through any of the centers. You get a gut feeling or you kind of get a feeling in your heart, something you intuit in your mind --> not the same as this transmission of knowing
if you get one of those felt senses, you get a gut feeling and you turn toward it, it is like how come, what is this about? Then the guidance, then the direct knowing, the understanding can begin

Exercise Topic:
15-minute monologue:
What is your experience of direct knowing?
(How has it appeared in your life? Where is it showing up? You might notice that there are some areas where it is more reliable. For some reason you have opened a portal in certain parts of your life. Maybe some areas you do not notice it as much. But where is it? What do you notice about it? How does it affect you?)
How has it revealed truths you haven’t seen before, and how has it helped you see through beliefs and conceptual ideas?
5-minute feedback: Share feedback with each person to help them further their exploration.
